<p>My grouse shooting days are now past. Increasing
years and rheumatic muscles remind me that I have
had my time, and a very good time too, so now let
younger men take my place and profit by my experience,
if it should so please them.</p>

<p>Let us look back on grouse shooting twenty-six
years ago. Scotland, so far as regards the sporting
of the far north, was then almost a <i>terra incognita</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>Railways ended at Inverness, and to get there
needed a journey to Aberdeen, and from there by the
slowest of slow railways, but quick enough&mdash;life was
not run at so fast a pace as now.</p>

<p>The more remote districts of the north and west of
Scotland were as unknown as the wilds of Labrador.</p>

<p>Previous to that time grouse shooting was for the
few; we were content with our English shootings, and
very nice and pleasant they were.</p>

<p>Every farmer, if the shooting was in his take, preserved
his game; he shot it or he let it. The stubbles
were long and full of weeds, the old pastures full of
feg, and there was plenty of clover, but turnips not
so much grown as now, excepting in the eastern
counties, about which I know very little, the hedges
and ditches not kept clean as they are now.</p>

<p>There was much less of hand rearing of pheasants;
the hens were spared certainly the second time
through, and nice mixed bags were made in covert
with hares and rabbits and wild pheasants, hand rearing
partridges being scarcely known.</p>

<p>Hares are now gone consequent on the Ground
Game Act, and without them the farmer does not find
it worth while to preserve, as the shooting will not let
without ground game.</p>

<p>The open shooting was mostly done by two guns
shooting together over dogs; in fact, you could not
find your birds or fur without them.</p>

<p>How I made acquaintance with my first grouse was
very funny; I will tell the tale:</p>

<p>I was at Scarborough with my wife and family, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
talking shooting in the smoke room of the hotel, I was
told as a great joke about the shooting on a moor of
about 3000 acres near Pickering that was commonage,
and free to anybody; of course, that was nonsense,
the only parties having the rights of sporting were
the commoners, and all others were trespassers; but
that did not now matter, anybody shot upon it, but
since then the commoners have been wise enough to
join together and let the shooting rights at a very
handsome rent.</p>

<p>Well, I was fired with the desire of seeing a grouse
on the wing. It was rather slow for me at the seaside.
I fancy that most paterfamilias find it so.
Saying nothing, and cogitating the matter over, I
determined to begin my first Twelfth, and accordingly
I sent for a brace of my dogs from the south.</p>

<p>The shooting being free, it was necessary to be on
the moor before daylight. Therefore I went over
to Pickering by train in the afternoon of the eleventh,
had some dinner at the inn, and hired a trap and
man to drive me over, the driver to officiate as gilly
or keeper, and, he being a Yorkshireman, anything
in the way of sport could not come amiss to him.
I found him keen as mustard to get me on the ground
in good time, and at a good starting point.</p>

<p>With the first gleam of twilight the moor was
ablaze with the fire of some thirty or more guns.</p>

<p>My first grouse was down before I could see him.
Something fluttered up, I shot in the line, down came
a bird, and to my intense delight I handled my first
grouse&mdash;a fine old cock bird.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>In three hours the whole thing was over, every bird
not killed was put off on to neighbouring ground.</p>

<p>I had managed to get two and a half brace, and
thought myself very lucky. I dare say a hundred
brace were got off in that short three hours.</p>

<p>I took myself away to Saltersgate Inn, a comfortable
wash up, some breakfast, and a nap, and in the afternoon
quietly back to Pickering, and home to dinner.</p>

<p>That finished my grouse shooting for that season,
but I had caught grouse fever.</p>

<p>The following season I joined some other men for
a few days' shooting over dogs on a small moor in the
county of Durham, and had a few pleasant enjoyable
days, getting, perhaps, thirty brace in all. At
that time grouse sat very fairly well to dogs for the
first ten days in the English counties, as they now
do in Perthshire and Aberdeenshire, but there was
nothing like the quantity of birds on the English
moors that there are now. One odd thing may be
remarked: In all my sporting career I never shot but
one curlew, and that was on this moor. Of birds,
they are the wariest of the wary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="SEASON_1863" id="SEASON_1863"></a>
     <a href="#anchor-1863" style="text-decoration: none;">
    <span class="smcap">Season 1863.</span></a></h2>


<p>The grouse fever was upon me at full fever heat,
and I was determined that I would solve the problem
of Scotch grouse shooting, and, finding in the spring
of this season that an Aberdeen innkeeper advertised
shooting, I wrote to him to know if he could put me
in the way of a small place for one gun. Of course he
replied glowingly, and said that a small moor by
Gartly station, in Aberdeenshire, then on his hands,
was quite enough for one gun, that capital lodgings
were to be had at the merchant's house, and the price
of the shooting for three weeks would be but £50.</p>

<p>I felt quite certain that I should be done, but I also
knew that knowledge and experience could only be
had by paying for it, so I plunged to what was not a
very costly plunge, and accordingly I sent down my
English keeper from Warwickshire.</p>

<p>In those days trains to Scotland did not afford the
luxuries of to-day. Sleepers were unknown, and in
the first-class carriage the elbow did not double up.
The extreme of luxury was a second-class compartment
retained for two men, and bed up the best way
you could.</p>

<p>I was again at Scarborough. It was a slow, weary
business to travel to York by a stopping train, and
then the whole night and half next day getting to
Aberdeen.  So I bethought myself of asking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
London and Aberdeen S.S. Co. to take me off at
Scarborough. This they agreed to do if I would lie
off in the offing and wait for the boat.</p>

<p>I went off in the afternoon of the day. It was a
fine day, fortunately, and I watched ship after ship,
and at last, about 4 p.m., the big paddle wheels of the
steamer loomed up.</p>

<p>It was the crack boat of the Aberdeen S.S. Co.;
she had been chartered as a transport during the
Crimean war, and was the only ship that rode out, or
steamed out, the heavy gale off Balaclava that wrecked
so many of our ships.</p>

<p>She tried to take me on board without a full stop,
but I would not see it, and drifted a long way astern,
causing considerable delay; but at last I was got up
the side.</p>

<p>The captain swore great guns at the idea of stopping
his ship for one passenger. I agreed with him and
recommended him to swear at his directors in London;
and verily believe he would have sworn at them if he
had had them there to swear at.</p>

<p>A smooth and lovely passage, arriving at Aberdeen
about 11 a.m. next morning.</p>

<p>On arriving off the coast of Fife we ran through a
school of whales, spouting and tumbling about in the
most idiotic manner.</p>

<p>Arrived at Aberdeen I lunched at my friend the
innkeeper's, who impressed me with the exceeding
merits of my take, and the grouse I should get.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I was away by train to Gartly, and
there found my keeper and dogs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>The lodgings were very plain, but good enough,
and there, fortunately for me as turned out, also, lodging
and shooting a moor rented from my innkeeper
at Aberdeen, was that grand old sportsman the late
Mr. Ginger Stubbs.</p>

<p>I am pretty certain that, my £50 being in view, that
my bit of ground was cut off from Stubbs moor as an
afterthought.</p>

<p>Mr. Stubbs was excellent company, and very good-naturedly
he taught me a great many useful things
that I desired to know about grouse shooting.</p>

<p>My moor was truly small: about an hour in the
morning hunted it, and then I let it rest till the afternoon,
giving birds time to work back home. The
whole bag was about thirty brace of grouse, some
grand brown hares, and a few sundries.</p>

<p>One of my dogs, never having been on grouse, until
she saw them killed, took no more notice of them than
she would of chickens.</p>

<p>A fortnight finished it, and I returned to England
wiser in grouse lore than when I went. The £50 was
well spent.</p>

<p>The novelty, the pure air, the heather hills, in fact,
the whole thing, was delightful; it gave me a very
considerable insight into grousing matters, and a
knowledge of grouse moors in that locality, that was
eventually of considerable use to me, and Stubbs put
me right in many ways.</p>

<p>According to the fashion of the times I was shooting
with a gun of 7-1/4lb. weight, and I was still further
handicapping myself by holding my left hand too near
the trigger guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"You shoot with too much gun," says Stubbs;
"push out your left hand along the barrels."</p>

<p>On my way south the Aberdeen innkeeper asked
me to join a party that he was making up to attend
the Highland sports that were to be held at Mar
Lodge. I was nothing loth, and joined the party.</p>

<p>He took us down very comfortably along Dee side
in a four horse omnibus, driven by himself, and gave
me the box seat by his side. I think that he felt
some compunction about the little do in respect to
the moor "that was enough for one gun."</p>

<p>I forgave freely enough.</p>

<p>Everything was well arranged, rooms having been
taken beforehand at the Hotel at Braemar.</p>

<p>The Prince and Princess of Wales were there (it
was just after their marriage), and, of course, a great
number of notables to meet them.</p>

<p>The whole affair was a large garden party; the
railway being only open to Aberdeen, and the hotels
in the locality not being so numerous or extensive as
they are now, there was no crowding on the ground.</p>

<p>I did not care much for the sports, in fact, I never
could see much in Highland sports, but other people
do, so let them enjoy them, but my trip pleased me
very much.</p>

<p>And so ended my first experience of Highland
shooting.</p>

<h2><a name="Season_1864" id="Season_1864">
  <span class="smcap">Season 1864.</span></a></h2>


<p>In the spring I prepared for another campaign, I
felt that I knew all about grouse moors and could
take care of myself, but I had yet much to learn.</p>

<p>I enquired in all directions, and came across a
gentleman who leased a large moor in Perthshire, the
Glenshee moor, extending from the Spital of Glenshee
to within a few miles of Braemar.</p>

<p>It was called 30,000 acres, probably might be 20,000.</p>

<p>The representations made to me were very good,
and I was referred to a gentleman in Birmingham,
who had shot there one or more seasons, and who
quite truthfully gave me a very good account, so far
as his experience went.</p>

<p>The moor was shot by four guns, shooting in two
parties, I took one gun at £100, finding my share of
dogs, ponies, gillies, &amp;c., and I very naturally congratulated
myself that I was well landed, and could
not be otherwise than in for a good thing, and safe
from all pitfalls left open for the unwary.</p>

<p>There was no lodge in Glenshee in those days, and
it had to be shot from the Spital Inn.</p>

<p>The guns had to ride ponies from three to eight
miles to get to their beats, men and dogs walking on
beforehand, so that nearly half the time and labour
was taken up in travelling to and fro', but as it turned
out it did not matter much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>The moor was a fine moor, with fine heather, but
with too much green ground upon it.</p>

<p>It included some of the high Grampians, and
marched with the Mar Forest on the one end, and
with Caen Lochan Forest on the east side.</p>

<p>For those who cared to climb 3000 feet and more,
and risk sprained limbs on the roughest of broken
rocks and boulders, there was a fair sprinkling of
ptarmigan.</p>

<p>I was fairly well dogged, I had my brace of dogs,
and beforehand on faith I had bought a middle aged
pointer bitch from the keeper for £5, and a very good
purchase she was; later on I bred some very good
puppies from her and my dog Rap, and in addition
to her I had my brace of dogs and my English keeper
to complete my team.</p>

<p>We all reached the Spital, hiring from Blairgowrie,
a day or two before the 12th, in high spirits and hopes
for the coming fray.</p>

<p>The morning after our arrival my keeper came to
me with a very long face, he had got it from the gillie
that we were done, fairly done brown, that there was
literally nothing on the ground. The moor was very
high, nothing under 1500 feet above the sea, rising to
3000 feet, the limit of heather, and a severe snow
storm late on in the spring had killed the young birds
and driven down the old ones to lower ground, the
lower moors below us were full of birds.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>I was very down in the mouth. I had, as I thought,
taken every precaution, and was also rather full of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
cleverness at getting into what I took to be so good a
thing, and had bragged considerably; but at the same
time would scarcely credit that such an extent of fine
ground could hold nothing. I said nothing, but waited
for the outcome.</p>

<p>On the morning of the Twelfth we went through the
usual routine of ponies, pannier ponies, gillies, dogs,
&amp;c., returning at night with a dozen brace of old birds
amongst us, perhaps not so many.</p>

<p>The next day the same farce was enacted on another
side of the moor, with worse results.</p>

<p>That night there was a great talk of what could be
done with deer. In October, perhaps, something
might be done, but in August they were well kept in
by the Mar and Caen Lochan Foresters, and the talk
ended where it began.</p>

<p>After that my keeper and I scrambled about on the
high hills, after ptarmigan, an odd grouse, a hare or
two. One day I managed to get six brace of ptarmigan
and some dotterel&mdash;and very pretty birds they
were.</p>

<p>Ptarmigan are curious birds on the Glenshee hills,
the ground being so desperately rough it needed all
your wits to walk and take care of your gun, marking
down the birds as they fluttered up like pigeons.</p>

<p>It was useless to shoot at a bird unless you could
make sure to kill him outright, as the wounded birds
crept into holes amongst the rocks like rabbits.</p>

<p>When the birds were marked down you got to them
the best way you could, and had to look very sharp to
distinguish them from the colour of the stones as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
crept about. You would then shoot one on the
ground, and take another as they rose.</p>

<p>The old cock birds in their summer plumage were
very handsome birds.</p>

<p>I soon had enough, and in about a fortnight made
tracks for the south.</p>

<p>But before going south I suggested to the boss of
the shooting, who had let me the gun, that, as he must
have known before he let it what the state of things
would be, he should, anyhow, return one half the
money, and that more especially as there was one
corrie that held birds, and, at the solicitation of the
keeper, I had let them alone, being the only breeding
stock left to him, but I could make nothing of him.
One of the other guns, whom I will call Fred, and
who had shot there several seasons, also pressed the
matter sharply, but his blandishments were of no
effect, and Fred was so annoyed that he said he would
shoot there no more, and would be glad to join with
me in taking a place, if we could find one pretty accessible,
that would carry two guns shooting together.</p>

<p>In those days there were practically no agents, in
the modern acceptance of the term, excepting Snowie,
of Inverness. There were, also, very few advertisements,
and accessible moors were in no great plenty,
and such as there were, were let to permanent
tenants, who renewed their leases at the old rents;
in fact, it was pretty much the rule that so long as
the old tenant chose to remain there should be no
rise of rent. Times were then easy with landowners,
and they were easy with their tenants.</p>

<h2><a name="Season_1865" id="Season_1865"><span class="smcap">Season 1865.</span></a></h2>


<p>I kept a careful watch over the advertisements in
the <i>Field</i> and other papers, and in the spring I noted
the following advertisement on a certain Saturday:</p>

<p>"To be let, the Shootings of Glenmarkie, in Aberdeenshire
and Banffshire, extending over 11,000 acres
of moor and low ground; references to last tenant.
Application to be made to Mr. Snowie, of Inverness,
or the Law Agents in Edinburgh."</p>

<p>I did not sleep upon it, but wrote that night to my
law agents in Edinburgh, asking them to call first
thing on Monday morning upon the advertisers, and
telegraph me the rent and the name of last tenant.
The reply was prompt; the late tenant was Mr. Thos.
Powell, of Newport, Mon.; proprietors, the Fife
Trustees; the rent, £265. I telegraphed immediately
to a mutual friend at Newport, and received my reply
on the Tuesday morning by letter.</p>

<p>Mr. Powell reported that it was a capital moor,
with splendid birds, and lots of them, but needed to be
shot quickly, as they packed early; that, in addition
to grouse, there were a great number of large brown
hares on the lower beats, but that he could say nothing
about the partridges and snipe on the low ground
as he had never troubled with them.</p>

<p>Mr. Powell had given up the place to take some
very large deer forest, but that did not satisfy him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and some of my readers will probably remember
that not very long afterwards, whilst on a shooting
expedition after big game in Abyssinia, accompanied
by his wife and family, the whole party were
massacred.</p>

<p>Fred knew the moor perfectly well at second hand
through a friend who had shot upon it a few years
previously, and two years before at Gartly I had
gathered information about this identical moor, so,
without delay, by 10 a.m. on Tuesday morning, I had
telegraphed my Edinburgh agents to close a seven
years lease at £265, which, as my agents could
satisfy the proprietors' agents as to my eligibility
as a tenant, was at once agreed to, and so Fred
and I were joined in what proved a very pleasant
partnership.</p>

<p>To illustrate the keenness for really good places in
those days at the moderate rents at which things
went, a Staffordshire gentleman had written on the
Saturday for particulars of the moor, and was replied
to in due course on the Monday.</p>

<p>He accepted by letter on the Tuesday, but by
telegraph I had instructed my agents to conclude the
matter, and was thus before him.</p>

<p>Having taken the shooting, the next best thing was
to go and look at it.</p>

<p>The bulk of the grouse ground was in Banff, and
extended over about 7000 acres, including 1000 acres
adjoining, that we rented at £15 a year from a neighbouring
proprietor.</p>

<p>In addition to the grouse ground there was about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
3000 acres of rough hills, partly in gorse, bracken,
broom, patches of heather, and rough pastures.</p>

<p>This rough ground carried a goodly number of
grouse, beside snipe, golden plover, brown hares, and
some few rabbits.</p>

<p>The low ground consisted of about 2000 acres of
small arable farms prettily mixed up with the rough
ground and the lower beats of the moorland.</p>

<p>There were enormous brown hares everywhere
excepting on the higher grouse beats.</p>

<p>The moorland was full of grouse, and the heather
splendid, but had not been sufficiently and judiciously
burnt.</p>

<p>One hill side of about 1500 acres, nearly a fourth of
the grouse ground, was deep old heather all in one
patch, without a break in it.</p>

<p>It was frightfully dangerous in case of fire, as the
whole would have swept away in one terrific blaze.</p>

<p>It was late in the season, but at once we put in two
belts of burning, dividing it into four, and the next
season burnt it properly in strips, improving the feeding
and nesting ground.</p>

<p>On the one side we were bounded by the river
Deveron, and there was salmon fishing, but they were
late, and as red as mahogany, and also very stiff to
rise; in fact, the few that we had were taken with the
worm in the rocky pools, so the salmon fishings were
very little worth. The trout fishing was not much
account, though in the month of May fair baskets
could be made during the rise of the March brown.</p>

<p>The lodge was small but well enough situated, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
seven miles from Huntley. As a matter of course
the windows looked on to the wrong point of view,
but that is almost always the case in the older shooting
lodges. There was a small but very productive
garden between the lodge and the river; at end of
August and beginning of September the bush fruit
and the strawberries were splendid.</p>

<p>The situation of the lodge by the river side was
very pleasant, and made gay by flowering annuals,
which were much brighter in colour than those grown
in the south.</p>

<p>We were very fortunate in the minister, who was
a gentleman and a scholar, and we liked the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>Little more than a stone's throw from the manse
was a salmon pool, and regularly after breakfast and
after tea, no matter the state of water or weather,
our old minister fished the pool once up and once
down, it might take him five to ten minutes.</p>

<p>He was very reticent as to his success, but our
impression was that he had about a fish a week the
season through&mdash;of course he would fish blank during
drought, but he fished away all the same.</p>

<p>Our next door neighbour was Beldornie, with its
little old fashioned castle, a habitable castle, and let as
the lodge for the Beldornie shooting, and the banks of
the river between our lodge and the castle were
pretty steep and beautifully wooded with natural
hazel, birch and ash.</p>

<p>The kennels were pretty good, and as Fred and I
shot together, three or four brace of dogs did us well.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i024.jpg" id="i024.jpg"></a>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>We were well dogged for the 12th, with my three
dogs and three of Fred's; one of his was a queer
beast, a rough-looking rugged Russian setter. He
was honest, staunch, and industrious, and quartered
his ground well, but nothing would stop him, you
might whistle and whistle till you were hoarse until
he got into the neighbourhood of birds, and then down
he sat on his rump and would wait, aye an hour if
need be. Very rarely did he spring birds, as he did
not draw upon them until you were with him. On
one occasion so far did he go that we uncoupled
another dog and worked up to him, getting birds on
the way until we attended to his.</p>

<p>Fred and his wife and I went down a few days
before the 12th, and he and I had a skirmishing afternoon
on part of the rough ground, getting brown
hare, snipe, plover, and a rabbit or two.</p>

<p>The grouse ground was in six beats, but on the 12th
we went through some of the rough ground, getting
thirty-one brace of magnificent birds and some brown
hares and sundries, and the next day on a grouse
beat about sixty brace, and continued to make good
bags for several days, when the weather broke and
quickly pulled the joint bags down to thirty and
twenty brace a day.</p>

<p>We made about 370 brace, besides a lot of brown
hares and sundries, returning south early in September
to commence partridge shooting about the 10th of
September, which is early enough in most English
counties.</p>

<p>To get off a large bag would have needed two more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
guns shooting in another party, and so take off all
that was possible in the first week before the birds
began to pack, but we were happy enough, and did
not care to cram the little lodge too full.</p>

<p>To show how very ticklish the birds were, shooting
four days a week, it would take ten days to get over
the beats once, and during our lease we never
remember getting over the six beats before a break
of weather and the birds packing.</p>

<p>We carried our game, lunches, spare ammunition,
&amp;c., on a pannier pony. Our pony man, Geordie
Gordon, was a character&mdash;he was Jack of all trades,
minister's man, clerk to the kirk, and pony man in
the shooting season, and also did what gardening was
needed, his dialect the purest Aberdeen, so pure that
I always needed an interpreter. He was expected
to keep his eyes upon and mark wide birds. On one
occasion a bird towered&mdash;"Where did he go, did you
mark him, Geordie?" "Yes, yes, up, up, up&mdash;up
there," said Geordie, pointing to the sky.</p>

<h2><a name="Season_1866" id="Season_1866"><span class="smcap">Season 1866.</span></a></h2>


<p>This season we added three puppies of Nell and
Rap's to the kennel; they were liver and white like
the old dogs, so we called the family Mr. and Mrs.
Rap, and the young Raps, but though the puppies
turned out well, none of them came up to old Rap.
He would do anything, point, retrieve, catch rats,
rabbiting, or anything you liked.</p>

<p>He would do what not one dog in twenty, aye! in
fifty, will do: if he had a slant wind of birds he
turned back and took a round swing to get his wind
properly; with most dogs you have to whistle and
work them round by hand.</p>

<p>I bred him from a pure heavy Spanish pointer dog
and a well-bred English bitch, but one so rank that
her owner gave her to me to breed from, and then
make away with her. I kept three puppies out of the
litter, but, excepting Rap, although better looking,
they were no good&mdash;no real work in them. They
would have sold well, but I preferred to shoot them to
selling the man who would have bought them.</p>

<p>One other very good-looking likely puppy I gave to
the old Marquis de la&mdash;&mdash;, but I believe, as the old
gentleman made a pet of him, and endowed him with
a collar and bells, and would have shaved him had he
had anything to shave, that his sporting career was
not brilliant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>I came by Rap's father rather oddly: he belonged
to a working carpenter, who had picked up the puppy
at some nobleman's place where he had been working,
had broken him well, and he was a very careful, slow
ranger, the very thing for English shooting in the days
of stubbles, and I had had my eye upon him all the
early summer, and at last, about the middle of August,
I negociated the purchase for £7; but the dog never
came, and I could not get to hear anything about him.
But in the afternoon of August 31 up comes Mr.
Carpenter and his dog to "implement" the bargain,
as Scotch people would say. I wanted to know
how the delay came about, and, after a lot of cross-questioning,
it came out that General &mdash;&mdash;'s coachman
and he had agreed that the dog was to be planted on
the general at £12, and the difference of £5 to be
divided between coachman and carpenter; but the
planting did not come off, so in the eleventh hour he
was brought up to me, and I was glad to take him.</p>

<p>As Shot, the Spanish dog, grew old, he became very
dodgy; he had the run of the house, and would get away
and hunt the hedges for the labourer's dinners and
bring them home, napkins and all; and, if taken into the
town to the butcher's shop, he would go, and, somehow
or other, get away unperceived with a piece of meat.
He was never caught red handed, at any rate by the
butcher, who was consequently accused of base slander.</p>

<p>The staunchness of those Spanish pointers was
remarkable. On one occasion he was pointing and
roading, and pointing a landrail in a patch of clover;
the bird was headed and rose, and flew right towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the dog's mouth. Shot opened his mouth, and closed
it on the bird, and then he stood stock still without
moving a muscle.</p>

<p>He never attempted to meddle with game or rabbits,
but if he came near a tiny rabbit just out of the
burrow he would pick him up and bolt him like a pill.</p>

<p>This was a very good season, the second day
getting over 100 brace to the two guns, shooting
together over the same dogs&mdash;getting in all about 400
brace in the season, besides hares and sundries.</p>

<p>But Fred, when we left the place, was full of fear
and trembling, as at the latter end we got two or
three badly-diseased birds. Fred knew what disease
meant; but to me it was something new yet to learn;
and, looking at the magnificent stock of fine healthy
birds, I made light of his fears.</p>

<p>When we took the place, and afterwards went down
to look at it, every inquiry was made as to disease,
but not a soul would own to anything. It was stated
on all hands that on Glenmarkie disease was a thing
unknown, but Fred did not believe in its being so.
I daresay many of my readers have been told the
same flattering tale about other moors, and with the
same results.</p>

<p>Before leaving we discharged the keeper; we could
not do with his domineering ways, and, after careful
inquiry, we engaged young David Black, a son of a
keeper of Lord Airlie's. He came of a good game
keeping stock, and was all that we could wish for.</p>

<p>He was married to an Orkney woman; we liked
them both, and they have been in my service ever
since, which should speak well for master and man.</p>

<h2><a name="Season_1867" id="Season_1867"><span class="smcap">Season 1867.</span></a></h2>


<p>This was indeed a disastrous season; it was really
frightful. Fred's worst fears were more than realised.
In the spring disease raged with intense virulence,
dead birds lying about in scores on the green ground
by the waterside and elsewhere&mdash;many in full plumage
and apparently in full health. Before the 12th, with
the exception of a few broods on the rough ground,
there was practically, so to speak, not a bird left upon
the grouse ground.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>The whole district was in the same condition; and
it goes without saying that we did not go near the
place. Fred said, gloomily enough, "There will be
no grouse shooting for three years," and he was
practically right.</p>

<p>David Black reported that the spates on the river
brought down dead birds in such quantities as to
choke the surface of the eddies and backwaters.</p>

<p>I was almost in despair; I was very keen on the
shooting, and I had struggled hard for five years to
get it, and realised but two good seasons out of the
five.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i010e.jpg" id="i010e.jpg"></a>

<h2><a name="Season_1868" id="Season_1868"><span class="smcap">Season 1868.</span></a></h2>


<p>Of course, we let the grouse alone for this season,
as well as in 1867. There were very few to let alone;
but the disease was gone, and we comforted ourselves
the best way we could with the low-ground shooting
in October.</p>

<p>David Black had worked up the low ground well.
When we first took the place there were very few
partridges. The first season there was a covey of
twenty-two birds close to the lodge. We let them
alone, and they had multiplied, and in addition there
were also a few odd pairs in other parts of the ground.
We had shot none, and they had had three years
jubilee and pretty good breeding seasons.</p>

<p>In these high, stormy countries, during heavy snows
the poor things can get very little food, and naturally
draw down into the stackyards for food and shelter,
and, if not carefully looked after, get potted by the
farmer, but are not of much good to him, as they are
little better than skin and bone.</p>

<p>Black looked after them. I don't think that our
former keeper troubled himself, or the stock would
have got up quicker; and there was now a fine
stock of all sorts of low-country game, pheasants
excepted. Of course, by a fine stock I mean a fine
stock for a wild stormy country.</p>

<p>We had a most enjoyable fortnight's shooting over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
dogs. In the twelve days we managed to make a
mixed bag of 600 head&mdash;partridge, snipe, plover,
brown hares, rabbits, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The grouse we let alone, except a stray old cock now
and again that had survived through the epidemic&mdash;very
handsome to look at, but, like the monarch of
the glen, very tough, and unsavoury on the table.</p>

<p>Of course, on that wild ground the covies of partridges
were, looking at the extent of ground, few
and far between.</p>

<p>The dogs hunted the small turnip fields and the
ground round the edges of the oat stubbles, say, for a
hundred yards about. It might be wooded burn sides,
or deep feg or heather, and, perhaps, whins and
broom. The birds took a lot of finding. Of course,
we got other stuff, meanwhile, on the way; and the
covey once found, and flushed again and again in
neaps, brackens, heather, or what not, the dogs kept
pegging them until the covey was pretty well cleared
up. Sometimes a covey would utterly beat us by
settling into heavy patches of gorse that the dogs
would not face&mdash;at any rate, not work properly; and
as to walking them up with a retriever, they would
run about, but knew better than to flush.</p>

<p>After that very naturally we went down every
October until the end of the lease, and the last season
we had 190 brace of partridges alone.</p>

<p>When hunting near the moor edges we often got a
few grouse that were down to the stubble; and in
these delightful mixed bags over dogs, how a couple
of brace of fine grouse were appreciated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>These mixed bags in the crisp October air, the walking,
the variety of sport, though not the quantity,
beat the August shooting for enjoyment of sport. You
would not know what the dog's point might mean; it
might in some ground be hare, snipe, partridge, or
grouse. I have made doubles at hare and snipe. The
hares were splendid. You may not believe it, but Fred
made a double at hares that weighed 22lb. the brace.</p>

<p>One season I stopped over for an extra day by myself&mdash;it
would be the 18th of October&mdash;on the rough
ground, and made the following mixed bag over dogs:</p>

<ul class="unordered">
  <li class="txt-li">4 Grouse, stalked on the plough from behind the dykes.</li>
  <li class="txt-li">6 Partridges.</li>
  <li class="txt-li">2 Woodcock (very unusual).</li>
  <li class="txt-li">4 Snipe.</li>
  <li class="txt-li">9 Brown hares.</li>
  <li class="txt-li">2 Golden plover.</li>
  <li class="txt-li">1 Green plover.</li>
  <li class="txt-li">1 Rabbit.</li>
  <li class="txt-li">&mdash;</li>
  <li class="txt-li">29 Head.</li>
</ul>

<p>Grouse, when they get on the plough, are sometimes
very stupid, in the above case I stalked the four
birds, there were but four; I shot one on the ground,
did not show myself, let the bird lie; the others then
just fluttered up and flew fifty yards; and down within
reach of the dyke, got another, then the other two
again fluttered up and down again, that time I jumped
up and showed myself and got the pair right and left
as they rose.</p>

<p>Black said that we might go down in August and
stretch our legs, and kill a few grouse on the rough
ground, so down we went, and made about sixty
brace of grouse and a lot of sundries, especially
golden plover. Of these there were quantities, and
in ordinary August months we were far too busy
with grouse to heed them.</p>

<p>One afternoon a pack of green and a pack of golden
plover were very busy fighting and screaming for the
possession of a hill side, and so busy that they took
little or no heed of us, and four barrels dropped twelve
couple, of course, some of the cripples needed another
barrel.</p>

<p>There is one way, and an almost certain way of
circumventing flocks of golden plover: they are very
inquisitive birds, you will see them on the face of the
hill, mostly small round hills; let the keeper sit down
with the dogs, say 100 yards in front of them, and
whilst they are watching him, slip quietly round the
hill, over the top, down on the flock before they are
aware of you, and a family shot into the brown with
two barrels of No. 8 will sometimes bring down two
or three couple.</p>

<p>We had a good deal of trouble with fellows coming
up from Huntly, fishing. Powell had let anybody
come, and it was difficult to stop it. One morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
we saw a young fellow putting a salmon rod together
on the other side of the river, I sent over the under
keeper, Sandy, a big, strong Highlander, to put
him off; but he would not budge, he stated that we
were going out for our sport, shooting, and he meant
to have his sport, fishing. Sandy was again sent over
to intimate that if he fished he was to take his rod
and put him personally into the salmon pool. "What,
take my rod and put me in the river, contrary to
law?" Sandy simply said he had no option, it was
the master's orders, and he took the rod as a beginning.
I was summoned for illegally taking the rod, and
took out a counter summons for the fishing, each
party was fined by the sheriff, the fisher much heavier
than we were, but my decisive action stopped all
further trouble. If I had not taken the rod I should
not have got the fellow's name.</p>

<h2><a name="Season_1870" id="Season_1870"><span class="smcap">Season 1870.</span></a></h2>


<p>Three years weary patience was rewarded in the
fourth year with a fine grouse season, and, not being
quite so thick upon the ground as in ordinary good
seasons, the grouse sat better, and in the second and
third weeks we made better bags than was customary.</p>

<p>Our lease was running out, this was the sixth
season.</p>

<p>The factor did his best to induce us to renew for
another seven years. I was anxious to do so, notwithstanding
our disappointments, but my chum did
not seem to care to do it, and I hardly liked to do so
without him, and very much I afterwards regretted it.</p>

<p>The factor had always used us well, in the best
possible manner, he had an old-fashioned notion that
decent folks who paid a good round sum for sport and
gave no trouble, were entitled to consideration, and
to have something for their money; the modern factor
quite discards ideas so very ridiculous.</p>

<p>In the spring of this season I was down with my
second son for some trout fishing in the river, and we
had some pleasant sport, being favoured with two or
three small rises of water and a good show of March
browns. We managed to make nice little baskets of
6lb. to 7lb. each on most days, fishing the Beldornie
water as well as our own.</p>

<p>We had, neither of us, ever seen a red deer&mdash;anyhow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
on his native heath&mdash;and we decided to make a
day out to Glen Fiddoch Forest.</p>

<p>We knew that it was five miles across the Glenmarkie
ground to the extreme point of our outside
march at Auchendown Castle, and how much further
we knew not. That, bear in mind, was before the
days of ordnance maps.</p>

<p>We were all good walkers, that is, David and myself,
and my son Oliver; he held a front place in athletics
at Rugby School.</p>

<p>We crossed the moor south of Auchendown, and
then got at last on to the road track to Glen Fiddoch
Lodge. Altogether, it was a long tramp, the last few
miles following up the Fiddoch burn, but time and
labour at last landed us at the lodge.</p>

<p>The lodge was very old-fashioned, was all on the
ground floor, with rooms on one side of a long building,
and a passage on the other side.</p>

<p>The housekeeper was a civil old body: would give
us some tea, which we appreciated, and made much
of us in every way; showed us the room that had
been used by the Queen the year before, when visiting
the Duke. Everything was simple in the extreme. I
am sure that no broker would have bid over eighteen
pence for the washing stand in the Queen's bedroom.</p>

<p>On our way we saw deer by scores on the hill sides,
and also round the lodge.</p>

<p>All was very pleasant up to now, but there was the
walk back. By the time we reached Auchendown we
had had enough, and there was the five miles across
heavy moorland yet to be done. Some people say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
that your native heath, and the springiness of the
heather, make walking pleasant and easy, but don't
believe it; my notion has always been that one mile
of moorland is equal to two on the hard road.</p>

<p>David was fairly done. It is not the first time that
I had walked down the natives, both in Ireland and
in Scotland, but I never expected to see David brought
to a stand.</p>

<p>Well, we laid down and rested a good hour, refreshed
with biscuits and whiskey and water, and put the five
miles behind us before dark.</p>

<h2><a name="Season_1871" id="Season_1871"><span class="smcap">Season 1871.</span></a></h2>


<p>The proprietor, to our very great surprise and
astonishment, intimated to us and to the tenants of
the arable farms on the Fife estates, that, on the
expiration of the current sporting leases, they should
have the right to kill ground game on their arable
farms, how and when they liked.</p>

<p>This was a knock down blow. I am inclined to
think that the factor had an inkling of it when he
pressed us to renew; that he wanted to make his
sporting leases safe, so that they should not be affected
by it.</p>

<p>There were forty tenants in Glenmarkie who would
have the right to shoot, and, naturally, I did not see
my way to preserve game on the low ground in the
teeth of that, so, with great reluctance, we told our
good factor that we should have to go.</p>

<p>He offered considerable reduction in rent&mdash;anything
to induce us to stop, except rescinding the
ground game fad, and that he could not do.</p>

<p>The only reason that could have suggested such
action on the part of the proprietor must have been
political, probably to outbid M'Combie, the Radical
candidate for Aberdeenshire; but so it was, and there
was no way of getting over it.</p>

<p>The stock of grouse upon the ground was very large,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and the late Mr. O. joined us in the grouse time, and
after the first two days he and Fred shot together.</p>

<p>In the first two days shooting together Fred and I
made over the same dogs over one hundred brace a-day.
The total bag in the two days was two hundred and
ten brace of grouse, and some sundries; and I have but
little doubt that, if I had been bent on a swagger bag,
shooting by myself, commencing at 8 a.m. in place
of 11 a.m., I could have made a hundred brace
in one day to my own gun.</p>

<p>After that I managed the birds pretty well by
myself, and when they became skittish, by starting
about from 12 to 1 o'clock, and hunting the wild
ground into good sitting ground, taking time for
lunch, and beginning to work the birds about 3 to
4 o'clock, I made pretty shooting.</p>

<p>I had to work the dog myself, the gillie keeping
down in the heather out of sight.</p>

<p>Old Rap was gone, I hope to where good dogs go,
for he deserved it if dogs can deserve it.</p>

<p>His two sons, Duke and Prince, did my work.
Duke was a nice-mannered, tractable, gentle beast,
but Prince was a rank tartar.</p>

<p>So soon as you loosed him from the couples, he
would do some rank trick, get on the foot of a hare,
or what not; then come in to the whip, get it hot,
wag his tail, and then for some time go to work
with a skill and courage far beyond Duke, then again
to the whip, and so he went on to the end of his days.</p>

<p>One afternoon I had a laughable sell&mdash;the laugh
was against me, though. My chums were not going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
out, so I drove my birds carefully into sitting ground,
that was principally on what was their beat.</p>

<p>I got a fine lot of birds into good ground, and at
3 p.m. rose up from lunch to make what I knew would
be a good afternoon's work, rather out of the
common.</p>

<p>As I got up, who should I see but David and the
two chums coming round the shoulder of the hill, into
the ground I had carefully filled with birds. They had
point after point, and made an unexpectedly fine
afternoon's shooting, about twenty-five brace of birds.
They had not the slightest notion how it came about.
I said nothing, not I, as I had rather stretched a point
by driving into their beat, but David knew that something
had been done to get them this good shooting,
and worked it out of my gillie after we got home, and
a pretty laugh there was, and no thanks.</p>

<p>Of course I got no shooting that afternoon; perhaps
a brace or two before lunch, and a brace or two after.</p>

<p>It was a charming season; exceptionally nice
weather, no gales, plenty of sun, and just enough rain
to keep things pleasant and scent good.</p>

<p>My own bag was three hundred and ninety-one and
a-half brace, and one hundred and fourteen brace of
partridges in October, besides a lot of brown hares,
plover, snipe, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Altogether we had a good way over six hundred
brace, and a special good time with the low ground in
October.</p>

<p>The snipe shooting was far better in the earlier
years of our lease. It was, indeed, very good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
especially in one swamp of a few acres, that was
too soft for cattle to tread it, and there the snipe bred
in large quantities; but an enterprising farmer came
along with some large pipe drains, and settled the
snipe. It was a sad pity, but you cannot hammer into
proprietors that the value of the snipe shooting far
exceeds the couple of pounds extra value of grazing
caused by draining, in fact, that snipe shooting would
with some men be the turning point of whether they
took the shooting or not.</p>

<p>It was getting time to look about me for another
shooting, and, making enquiries, I had the offer of a
celebrated moor not far away, up in Strathspey.</p>

<p>The moor was noted for swagger bags on the first
few days, so I sent David to inspect and report, which
he did faithfully and fully. It was a grand place, and
the rent moderate.</p>

<p>He was given every information, and shown the
game books with a record of twenty-five years (that
takes us back in the records of disease for nearly
half-a-century). On the average, it showed but three
good seasons out of seven.</p>

<p>I was very much surprised, and I did not feel
inclined to face that, but many to whom money is no
object, and who can shoot elsewhere as well, would
say, "Yes, we will pay seven years' rent and expenses
for three years of extraordinary sport in the three
good seasons." It ended in my declining it.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Some two or three years previously I had been in
Caithness for a fortnight's salmon fishing at the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
February, on the Thurso. If I remember rightly,
Mr. R. L. Price had given me his rod on the river for
that time.</p>

  <div class="caption">Braal Castle.</div>
</div>

<p>Then, at Braal Castle I made the acquaintance of
William Dunbar, an acquaintance that lasted so long
as Dunbar lived, and still continues with his widow,
and his daughter, Mrs. Sutherland.</p>

<p>Dunbar was a very remarkable man in his way. He
made his living by taking shootings and fishings from
Caithness proprietors.</p>

<p>Acting under his advice, the proprietor opened up
the main strath, by making a road from the county
road at Strathmore, past Dalnawillan and Glutt, to join
the road at Braemore on to Dunbeath, and so open
up access to Glutt and Dalnawillan from the south,
without going round by Wick or Thurso.</p>

<p>He also built Strathmore and Dalnawillan lodges
and keepers' houses, kennels, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Dunbar leased from the proprietor the whole of the
fishings and shootings from the sea to the Sutherland
march, and in addition many smaller shootings in the
Wick and Watton districts from other proprietors,
who all knew little or nothing about sporting subjects
(and, as a matter of fact, they and their factors know
as little now), still less how to make them available
for, and how to introduce them to, southern sportsmen.
As it was, Dunbar was really a perfect godsend to the
various proprietors, and to the county of Caithness
generally, from the large sums of money brought into the
county by his shooting and fishing friends and tenants.</p>

<p>The Ulbster shootings, which constituted the main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
strath when I first knew Dunbar, were divided as
follows, or thereabouts, including about 5000 acres
leased from other proprietors:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Thurso salmon angling was let to six rods, and
the anglers lodged in the early months at Braal
Castle, and later on at Strathmore Lodge.</p>

<p>In those days the lower beats fished well in
February and March, the fish running from 8lb. to
10lb., with an occasional big one; but now in the
early months they run about double the weight, few
and far between, and make up almost at once for
Loch More and the upper beats. The reason for the
change is not far to seek.</p>

<p>Dunbar had a happy knack in letting shootings and
fishings. He understood sport, was frank, truthful,
and kept back nothing. It did not need an old hand
to read between the lines of his statements.</p>

<p>He was pretty keen in making his bargains, but once
made he did his best to make things comfortable for
his clients. He went for a connection, and he made
one. There was not a grain of meanness or littleness
in his composition; whether in the bond or not he did
the fair thing. He knew how to deal with gentlemen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and men felt safe in his hands, and voids in his
shootings and fishings were rare.</p>

<p>He was popular in Caithness with all classes.</p>

<p>Fred elected not to continue grouse shooting, and
our pleasant partnership came to an end, and I had to
decide what I would do.</p>

<p>When in Caithness, I had picked up all the
information I could gather as to Caithness moors.</p>

<p>In all ways they were the very opposite to
Glenmarkie. Grouse sat well for quite a month,
rather more on the hill moors, and rather less on the
low moors, and nowhere did they pack, except in
heavy snowstorms when the ground was all white, and
they made away to the lower grounds for food.</p>

<p>There was nothing like the quantity of grouse that
I had at Glenmarkie, but the ranges were larger&mdash;wide
ranging dogs and good walking imperative; but when
dogs got birds they sat well.</p>

<p>There was also a considerable quantity of wild fowl,
wild geese, ducks, and blue hares; very few on
Glenmarkie. No low ground shooting, in fact, no
arable on the hill moors.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>The heather was short and stunted, with stretches
of deer grass and flows; in fact, no good heather on
the hill moors. Excepting on the burn banks and
dry knolls, the ground was mostly peat bog, too soft
to carry a pannier pony, and the birds had to be
carried in panniers on gillies' backs.</p>

<p>The trout fishing in the upper streams and burns of
the Thurso that fed Loch More was pretty good. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
trout were plentiful but small, running about four to
the pound, but they came quick and lively. The loch
fishing was not much account; perhaps I should except
one loch, that yielded heavy trout of fine quality, but
very shy.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Glenmarkie was a Christian-like place, but the
principal moors of Caithness were a howling wilderness,
not a tree and scarcely a shrub; but it was a
wilderness of weird beauty in changing lights. The
outlook from the top of Ben Alasky on a wild stormy
day, with changing sunlight and storms, over the loch
bespattered land, backed up by the cliffs of Orkney,
was one of the things to see and to remember.</p>

<p>To me this wild and weird land has great charms.</p>

<p>Well, I wrote to Dunbar in the early summer to say
that my lease was expiring, and that I wanted a
shooting for 1872, and on a long lease.</p>

<p>He offered me one or two small ones in the Watton
and Wick districts, but I told him that I must have
Glutt, Dalnawillan, or Strathmore. He replied that
all were let on lease, and could not be had.</p>

<p>But in September he wrote again, saying that his
tenant Col. C., from failing health, desired probably
to relinquish the lease of Dalnawillan and Chullacan,
18,000 and 6000 acres respectively, and that they
could be had jointly or separately at £400 and £160,
for the unexpired term of the Colonel's lease, of which
there was nine years then to run.</p>

<p>I sent Black down to inspect and report.</p>

<p>It culminated as Dunbar had foreshadowed, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the latter end of October I went straight from Glenmarkie
to Dalnawillan.</p>

<p>The railway was then open to Helmsdale, and from
there I travelled by mail coach as far as Dunbeath, a
lovely drive past Berriedale, the property of the Duke
of Portland, but being night I could see but little of it
on that occasion.</p>

<p>I slept at Dunbeath, and posted over next morning,
16 miles, the whole distance across the moorland, to
Dalnawillan.</p>

<p>Angus Mackay, the Colonel's gillie, met me at the
march with a dog, and, getting the gun out of the case,
I shot up to the lodge.</p>

<p>The day was warm and sunny, and I was amazed
and puzzled; I saw no birds. At Glenmarkie they
would have rolled up over the sky line; but birds sat
to the dog, and I killed three and a half brace. Three
days before, at Glenmarkie, being the last day that I
should shoot, I tried to get a few grouse, my endeavours
resulting in one bird, but plenty of packs rising before
me.</p>

<p>The next day was showery and gusty, and the birds
did not sit well, but at Glenmarkie they would have
rolled up in packs.</p>

<p>I spent two nights at the lodge with the Colonel's
brother, who came over to meet me, and next morning
was away to Thurso to meet the Colonel and Dunbar.</p>

<p>It was agreed that the lease should be assigned. I
suggested a new lease from Dunbar, and that he
should make it the full ten years.</p>

<p>"Take it to the end of my lease, seventeen years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
if you like," says Dunbar, to which I assented; so it
was settled that I should take the 24,000 acres of
Dalnawillan, and Chullacan, and Backlas, at the rent
of £560, proprietor paying all rates and taxes, and I
paying my keeper and all other expenses.</p>

<p>This included a joint right of trout fishing on
Dalnawillan, Strathmore, and Glutt, and salmon fishing,
after June 1.</p>

<p>When I returned to England my shooting friends
told me that I was crazy to take shooting in such an
out-of-the-way, wild country, and tie myself up for
such a term of years. I felt I had done right; I meant
grouse shooting and fishing, and that, as railways had
crept up, and were creeping up, that shootings were
more likely to improve than get worse, in case of some
unforeseen event occurring that should cause me to
cease to shoot.</p>

<p>Black had made every inquiry as to disease. Dunbar
told me plump that five years before they had had
disease, but it was a mild attack, and did not stop
shooting. As, however, the moor had not carried a
good head of grouse until the year I took it, I expect
that the tenants shot away, killing down the breeding
stock that should have been nursed. It was admitted
that the moors on the south and east had been badly
hit with disease.</p>

<p>I took the place with my eyes open, and was prepared
to take the fat with the lean, but I candidly
confess that I had more lean than I expected or liked.</p>

<p>I looked for disease in 1874, but it came sooner.</p>

<p>Of course, the moor was larger than I needed for
my own personal use, and according to the fashion of
the time I proposed to get others to join me, so I
looked out for a couple of guns to share expenses.</p>

<p>It was proposed that the moor should be shot in
three parties of one gun each. There was no difficulty
in those days in getting guns to join, but it is very
difficult now. I take it, that before the passing of the
Ground Game Act there was more English shooting
of a moderate character, and, so to speak, men were
educated to shoot, and naturally were desirous of
trying their hands on grouse; besides, the shooting
squires are not so well to do throughout the country
as they were before the depression in land.</p>

<p>I advertised in the <i>Field</i> on a Saturday, and before
Monday was over a gentleman in Berkshire had been
straight to my place in Shropshire and arranged for
one gun, and the other was fixed before the end of
the week. Very nice, cheery, gentlemenly men they
both were. Mr. C. and Mr. D. were my colleagues.</p>

<p>My wife, my sister-in-law, and the children, accompanied
us in August; we had a sleeping saloon as far
as Helmsdale, the then terminus of Northern Railways.</p>

<p>That night we stopped at Ross's Hotel. Helmsdale
was the only entrance by road into Caithness, and
Ross's the only hotel, so the capacity of Ross's rooms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
was the gauge of the traffic. The Countess of
Caithness had our rooms the night before, and they
were booked for somebody else the night after us.</p>

<p>The next day Ross posted us in a <i>char-a-banc</i> the
thirty-two miles to Dalnawillan, stopping to lunch
and bait horses at Dunbeath; the luggage had gone
on before in two carts.</p>

<p>The drive to Dunbeath was lovely over the Ord
and past Berriedale, the Duke of Portland's place.</p>

<p>At Dunbeath after lunch the party walked down to
the sea to look at the rocks and fishing boats, and
we all enjoyed it thoroughly; after this break there
was a sixteen mile drive across the moorland, passing
Braemore and Glutt Lodges on the left.</p>

<p>There being no railway we made arrangements with
the Glutt party, and engaged with a carrier to bring
letters, supplies, &amp;c., from Dunbeath and take back
game bags, empties, &amp;c., the following day. We
were quite as well off, in fact, better than if we had
been fidgetted with railway, post-office, and telegraph
at our elbow.</p>

<p>Things went well with us, the shooting was
excellent, the Chullacan and Backlas beats were
especially full of birds that season. At Chullacan was
a very primitive farmhouse with a small cooking
place, and a room for us to serve as sitting-room and
bedroom. The farmer's room was at the other end
of the house, and in his case the smoke found its way
through the hole in the roof. At this place we lodged
twice for two nights, each time when we shot the beats
on that side. We were pretty cramped, making up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
three small beds at night; the morning bath we took by
standing outside the house in a state of nature while
the gillies douched us with pails of cold spring water.</p>

<p>The first time that we went over on the three days
shooting, I made forty-two, forty, and forty-five brace
to my own shoulder, and on our return we enjoyed
the comfort of a day's lazy rest amongst the comforts
of Dalnawillan Lodge. We were all very happy, my
two chums in raptures, and insisting on engaging
their guns for the next season.</p>

<p>The birds were healthy in a way when we left, but
did not look well in plumage. It had been a wet
draggly summer, and that partly accounted for it; but
before leaving we saw a few very seedy birds on our
Dunbeath march.</p>

<p>Dunbar had been very busy all the season for the
Duke of Sutherland.</p>

<p>At that time the shootings and fishings of the
Helmsdale Strath were divided into three great lumps
of ground:</p>

<table class="txt-table_2" id="Helmdale_Strath" summary="Helmsdale Strath Grounds.">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>I cannot be precise about the extent, but that was
about it.</p>

<p>Mr. Akroyd's, in Strath Naver, was almost unlimited,
and included nearly all the salmon fishing of the Naver.</p>

<p>The Duke was disturbed in his mind, or somebody
else was, and, Dunbar being the only man who really
knew anything about the management of shootings and
fishings, the Duke sent for him and engaged his services
to report on the whole matter of the Sutherland shootings
and fishings for the handsome fee of £1000, and
well earned too, as he was the only man that could do it.</p>

<p>Acting under his advice the Duke divided the
Helmsdale Strath into six shootings, with six salmon
rods on the river, one rod to each shooting at £50 for
those who chose to take them, and so the thing remains
to this day, but with rents increased and half the ground
taken away, the then existing tenants were somewhat
indignant, but there was nothing much to grumble about.</p>

<p>Mr. Hadwen, who lived upon his place, being very
little away, and also farmed the sheep, had built himself
a good house on a yearly tenancy, went to see the Duke
and the factor, Mr. Peacock, and they had a meeting
about it.</p>

<p>"Your grace, I have been your tenant now for
nearly twenty years, never dreaming that I should
be disturbed in any way! you now take away half the
shooting and increase the rent, and that after I have
spent 2000<i>l.</i> in building a good house on your land."</p>

<p>"Is that so, Peacock?" says the Duke.</p>

<p>"Yes, your grace, it is so."</p>

<p>"Then pay him for his house, and then we start
fair," says the Duke.</p>

<p>The accounts in the early spring were very cheering.
On the 1st of April Black wrote to congratulate us on
excellent prospects, not a bad bird had he seen since
we left in September. There was a grand breeding
stock, and he anticipated splendid shooting.</p>

<p>But it was not to be. On the 15th he writes
reporting birds looking badly diseased, and on the
30th writes again that a third of the birds were dead.</p>

<p>It was sickening news, but there was hope yet, as a
fair breeding stock was left, and the disease appeared
to have spent itself, the birds nesting fairly well.</p>

<p>At the beginning of July disease again broke out,
and with greater virulence, young and old birds falling
before it; but David begged us to come, of course, in
August and shoot down all we could, and so sweeten
the ground for those that remained by stamping out
all that was possible.</p>

<p>Disease prevailed over nearly all Scotland; amongst
others, Glenmarkie was very bad. We did not put
any birds on the table, and I sent none to my friends.
What few good-looking birds there were went to
London, and the scarcity through the country may
be imagined when I say that they made 19<i>s.</i> a brace.</p>

<p>My chums were pretty miserable, and so was I. It
was a bitter disappointment. No word from D. as to
taking a gun for the next season, and in about a week
or ten days they both went south. However, I had
to make the best of it, and, leaving my family at
Dalnawillan, I went into Sutherlandshire trout fishing
for a fortnight with my son Douglas, and after that
we all went home.</p>

<p>Caithness, in those days, was the worst mapped
county in Great Britain. There was a good estate
map of the Ulbster estates, and the maps were pretty
reliable for a few miles from the coast. Sutherland,
belonging mainly to one proprietor, was well mapped.</p>

<p>On Dalnawillan we had a loch&mdash;a long walk across
very bad ground from the lodge&mdash;that held, both in
size and quality, the best trout in Sutherland and
Caithness, but not plentiful; the best I ever did was
eighteen fish in a day, but eight of them weighed 9-1/4lb.,
the largest being 1-3/4lb., and that was the largest size
they ever reached, and, generally, a day's fishing
meant eight or ten, with the half of them the larger
size. A predecessor of mine at Dalnawillan assured
me that many were got up to 3lb. and 4lb.; it is marvellous
the falsehoods men will commit themselves to
as to size of fish&mdash;men perfectly reliable in other ways.</p>

<p>The gillies talked a good deal about a loch in
Sutherland, not far off our march, where the fish were
nearly as large and good, and very free to rise. That
sounded very nice, and needed to be experimented,
and my son Douglas and I said we would take it on
our way into Sutherlandshire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>In those days the lochs of Sutherlandshire were free
to the angler, and for some years the Duke made it a
condition in letting shootings that it should be so, and
as the bulk of the lochs were difficult of access, and
anglers few, there was no friction; and in the summer
months there were generally two or three rod men
stopping at Auchentoul Inn, on the Helmsdale Strath.</p>

<p>In the old Scotch fashion, the inn was part inn and
part shooting lodge, and in this case Sir John
Karslake's keeper kept the inn, so everything was
well regulated, and caused no annoyance to Sir John
or his deer. Sir John was always courteous and
pleasant.</p>

<p>Auchentoul Inn was twelve miles cross country&mdash;and
very cross country&mdash;from Dalnawillan, and we
sent our portmanteau to Dunbeath, sixteen miles,
thence by coach, sixteen miles, to Helmsdale, and
there to wait a chance lift up the Strath, eighteen
miles, to Auchentoul.</p>

<p>We also ordered a machine from Auchentoul to
meet us at Forsinean, ten miles by a decent road.</p>

<p>Willie Hunter, one of our gillies, vouchsafed to
pilot; he had herded sheep at this Loch Sletil, and
knew all about it. The ordnance maps now tell us
that it is seven and a half miles from Dalnawillan,
across a very bad piece of moorland and flow.</p>

<p>We left Dalnawillan at 8.30 a.m.&mdash;that is, David,
Douglas, and I, and Hunter as pilot; a nasty, wet,
drizzling rain; encased in macintoshes, wet outside
with rain and inside with perspiration, and after two
and a half hours tramping and slushing over the wet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
moors, Willie pulled up, and in a very confused
manner stated that we ought to be at the loch;
"anyhow, it used to be here," said Willie.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i058.jpg" id="i058.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i058.jpg"
      alt="Well! I know the loch used to be just here." />
  <div class="caption">"Well! I know the loch used to be just here."</div>
</div>

<p>A council was held to determine the present location
of this wandering loch, and a deviation of half a mile
to the right put us upon it. Willie returned.</p>

<p>After a rest we donned wading stockings, and put
rods together; it would be 12 o'clock by the time
we began; we had some nice fish, largest 1lb., but
our wading stockings would not put us into sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
deep water for the larger fish; but we saw enough to
convince us that the loch was not overstated.</p>

<p>We fished away, and packed up about 6 p.m. to
make our way across the moor to Forsinean.</p>

<p>Again we missed our way; we took the shoulder of
Ben Sletil too high up, and it was getting dark when
we struck the road, as it turned out, a mile on the
Auchentoul side of Forsinean. Of course no
machine.</p>

<p>It was raining; it had rained the whole day, and
looked as if it meant to rain for a week, and we took
off our macintoshes to lighten the walk&mdash;we could not
get much wetter. Presently we met a shepherd, who
told us Forsinean and the trap were behind us, and,
telling him to send the trap after us, we tramped the
hard road the whole nine miles, arriving at the same
time as the trap that followed.</p>

<p>Our portmanteau did not arrive till next morning,
but the innkeeper found us dry flannels and a good
supper; it was then 10 o'clock.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>C. was very hopeful that grouse matters would quickly
mend, and stuck to it for another season, and after
that I was left with the whole cost of the affair for
the following season, and seasons after that, which,
with rent, keeper, and expenses, was not less than
£700 a year, and nothing to shoot either, which was
the worst part of the business.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i010k.jpg" id="i010k.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i010.jpg"

<h2><a name="Season_1874" id="Season_1874"><span class="smcap">Season 1874.</span></a></h2>


<p>Neither C. nor I went near the place. Disease was
gone, and so were the birds. It could have been
truthfully advertised as perfectly free from disease,
and lightly shot the previous season. In May, before
nesting time, David hunted every beat, and found just
fifty-two pairs of birds on the whole 24,000 acres.</p>

<p>In August he again hunted, and came across exactly
the same number of broods as he had found pairs.
They certainly were grand broods, averaging eight to
a brood, and he managed to kill out nearly all the old
cock birds, leaving but one old bird to each brood.</p>

<p>Dunbar was very unhappy, and, of course, I was
the same, and we arranged to have a consultation,
and I met him in Edinburgh, where he had occasion
to be. Dunbar summed up the whole thing by saying,
in his plump way, there must be no birds whatever
killed for two years at least.</p>

<p>Glutt, in some way, was, fortunately, off Dunbar's
shoulders, and on the hands of the proprietor, who had
it in hand for three years afterwards, when Dunbar took
it off his hands at a moderate rent.</p>

<p>Strathmore was still on lease, the lease expiring
after the season of 1874, and, backing his opinion that
no birds should be killed in 1874, he arranged with
the tenants that, in consideration of no grouse being
taken off, he would abate half the year's rent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>He asked me if I would take Strathmore off his
hands for the remaining fourteen years of his lease.
"You shall have the whole 19,000 acres, including
Achlybster, for £350 a year." But I was not a jobber
in moors, and already had more than enough on my
hands; but, if I had been clear of Dalnawillan, I think
I would have closed with him.</p>

<p>The railway was making, and as the Rumsdale beats
are too far away from Dalnawillan Lodge to shoot
them conveniently from there, Dunbar suggested that I
should build a small lodge near to the proposed station,
and let off 10,000 acres of the Rumsdale side of Dalnawillan
so soon as the stock of birds would warrant it.</p>

<p>That idea suited me down to the ground, as the
remaining 13,000 or 14,000 acres attached to Dalnawillan
was ample for the personal shooting of myself
and sons, with, perhaps, a friend; the idea was
eventually carried out at the proper time.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>In July Douglas and I went to Rhiconich, on the
west coast of Sutherland, for a fortnight's sea trout
fishing. It was a disappointment; firstly, it was dry
hot weather, that, of course, stopped sea trout fishing.</p>

<p>In the evening the midges were something unbearable,
and drove us on to the sea loch trolling for
lythe. We were pretty successful, but very soon
used up everything in the shape of phantoms and
spinners, and had to take to small trout for spinning.</p>

<p>So soon as a lythe of any size took your spinner,
down he went into the seaweed tangle, and many
were lost and the spinner with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>We managed to get twenty-one lythe, weighing
83lb., of which some were up to 10lb., but we lost
most of the best fish in the weeds.</p>

<p>On our way back we stopped at Overscaig, on Loch
Shin, for a day's trout fishing, ending in a very
fatiguing fiasco; we had a boat and two rowers, David
and a gillie from the inn.</p>

<p>The morning was a nice fishing morning, and we
made our way down to the Faig mouth, and got on
pretty well, but, the wind changing, we put across to
the other shore, and fished away.</p>

<p>As the day wore on, the wind increased, blowing a
gale straight down the loch, so we got out of the
boat, and, with a good deal of trouble, hugging the
shore, the two men managed to get her back to just
opposite Overscaig.</p>

<p>There we found two other men, who had come up
from Lairg, and were in the same fix as ourselves.</p>

<p>It was raining heavily as well as blowing.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of a lull of wind, we tried to get
across, but when a third way across, the wind again
rose, and we had our work to do to edge the boat
head to wind to gain the shore without an accident.</p>

<p>What was to be done? asked the other party. I
said that I saw nothing for it but to walk round the
head of the loch. They consulted with their boatman
as to this, and then said they could not do it.
Certainly, they had come out with thin boots and
frock coats and white shirts, as they would have done
on a fine afternoon at Richmond, totally unfit to face
a wild Highland night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"We have had no dinner," says one; "of course,
we expected to get to Overscaig to dinner." "Well,"
I said, "we have a little of our lunch left, and you
are welcome;" but they turned away. I believe they
thought I was chaffing them.</p>

<p>However, there was the choice of stopping out on
the moor that wild night or footing it, and we chose
what we thought the lesser of two evils.</p>

<p>It was a very long three miles to head the loch and
the swamp at the top. The shore of the loch was
very deep peaty boggy ground, broken every fifty
yards with deep gullies and burns and drains, clambering
down and clambering up.</p>

<p>It was then quite dark, a howling wind and rain in
our teeth.</p>

<p>At last, with nearly two hours' work, we crossed
the Alt Na Ba Burn, and, heading the swamp, got to
the river that connects Loch Graim with Loch Shin.</p>

<p>But, horror! the river was in spate, and not safe to
cross.</p>

<p>We felt dead beat, and sat down in the wet; we
had a little whiskey and water, but nobody said
anything; one tried to light a pipe, but the matches
were wet, and so was everything else outside our
skins. We tried to look at our watches, but too dark
to see them.</p>

<p>It was getting towards midnight. We started
again, keeping along the banks of the river, to look
for a ford. Near the outlet of Loch Graim the river
was wider, and therefore the stream not so strong, and
the bottom was hard. I had a long landing-net staff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
and piloted the way; the water was up to the bottom
of the waistcoat&mdash;an even depth, and gravel bottom,
so we were all quickly safe across. Folks will say
what a fuss about crossing up to your middle; yes,
but handicap it with a dark howling night, an unknown
ford, and all your courage already pretty nearly
pumped out of you, and it will not be found to be
quite so simple as it looks.</p>

<p>There was yet a mile of swampy walking over
moorland, in the direction of the road, before it was
struck, but then we were not more than two and a
half miles from the inn, and soon put that behind us.</p>

<p>It was 1.30 a.m. when we reached the inn; they
were waiting up most anxiously, fearing some serious
accident, but could hardly credit that we had headed
the loch, and on such a fearful night.</p>

<p>I have had many long wet moorland tramps, but
nothing approaching to our Loch Shin episode.</p>

<p>I told David to see that our gillie had a good tea
and eating, and some hot whiskey and water, but he
came back to say the fellow was so thoroughly beat
that he had gone to bed, too tired and done up to eat
or drink anything.</p>

<h2><a name="Season_1875" id="Season_1875"><span class="smcap">Season 1875.</span></a></h2>


<p>In June I went to Dalnawillan trout fishing.</p>

<p>The Thurso river rises in the heights of the Glutt
shootings on the Sutherland march amongst a bewildering
labyrinth of flows and black morasses, hideous,
and gaunt. I have seen the inside of most Scotch
wildernesses, but there is nothing anywhere within
the four seas&mdash;aye, take in Ireland as well&mdash;that at
all approaches the plateau from which descend the
Berriedale, the Halladale, the Thurso, and the northern
water shed of the Helmsdale, at a height of about
1400ft. above the sea.</p>

<p>The Thurso, commencing and for many miles a
mere burn, descends from the heights through low
flats, interspersed with three rocky gorges or glutts
(from which, no doubt, the name of the shooting), of
from half a mile to a mile each in length, the burn
tumbling through them in a succession of small falls
and rocky pools; and in the lowest gorge was a waterfall
or force, as it would be termed in Yorkshire or
Westmoreland.</p>

<p>One day fly fishing up the river, as far up as the
entrance to the first gorge, I tried some of the rocky
pools. They were quite unsuitable for the fly, but I
took a number of pretty, little, bright trout.</p>

<p>Talking it over with the gillies next day, they said
there was no remembrance of anybody ever having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
taken any fish with rod and line, or any other way, up
in the rocky water.</p>

<p>Well, I bethought myself, as I felt sure there would
be fish as far up as there was water, and that something
might be done with the worm worth talking
about in a small way.</p>

<p>I was an adept in that style of fishing, having had
much experience and success in fishing small wooded
brooks in Warwickshire. My mode of fishing was
with a three-jointed light stiff bamboo rod, bored
down the middle; the line, a very thin one, passing
through and out at a hole near where the hand holds
the bottom joint.</p>

<p>When too long take off the bottom joint; no reel,
simply a few yards of line running loose behind, the
hook whipped to one or two feet of gut, and one
No. 6 shot about six inches above the hook, having
no rings, no line bagging, you could push in the point
of the rod anywhere, and drop the worm by shaking
the rod.</p>

<p>A large bag of small worms was provided, and the
tackle Stewart fashion, but with two small hooks
only, and pretty fine gut.</p>

<p>David and I started away, and were at the foot of
the lower gorge by 10 a.m., David behind me; and
soon the fun was fast and furious, every little fall and
the pool below it, the worm no sooner in the bubbles
and froth than tug, tug, tug. "Lift him out, unhook
him David and bait again; no, the worm will do." Tug
again; "Unhook him and bait this time." Tug again.
"Well, three out of that little hole is not so bad!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>David was disgusted at messing with such trash, as
he termed it, but soon even he warmed to it.</p>

<p>The waterfall had a nice pool scooped out by the
falling water, and, standing down stream below the
fall, thirty came out of that place.</p>

<p>It was great fun to come across water and fish in
these islands that were totally unsophisticated.</p>

<p>We worked up and up for miles, until the burn&mdash;aye,
and the fish too&mdash;began to get very small, and
at five o'clock we turned back, fishing a few of the
best places on our way. The waterfall gave but two
more, and I expect that was the last two in the pool.</p>

<p>Weighed at the lodge, deducting the basket, they
scaled just 23-1/2lb., and counted out 188 trout, just
eight to the pound, and pretty little bright fellows
they were.</p>

<p>David looked at them deprecatingly; repentance at
being a party to anything so derogatory had come
over him, and he viewed them philosophically, with the
sole remark, "What a mess!"</p>

<p>My fishing was in low water. My son Douglas
went up a few days after, meeting a rise of water,
and he also had a great number, but out of places
that I had not fished in low water.</p>

<p>The waterfall yielded none.</p>

<p>The burn was tried again on another day, but it
was done for a season or two; as in other things in
the world, you can't eat a cake and have it.</p>

<p>In August I took down my family party for their
holidays. There would be little or nothing to shoot,
a few cock birds to pick out of the broods and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
sundries, of course. The boys could fish away for
trout and get a few odd salmon out of the Upper
Thurso and Loch More, but they were very coppery
and red at that season.</p>

<p>During the first fortnight David and I hunted the
whole of the ground, killing the old cocks out of the
broods when opportunity occurred.</p>

<p>The increase of birds was very satisfactory, quite
150 broods on the ground, and fine broods too.</p>

<p>Dunbar had been very fortunate, and let Strathmore
to an old connection; rather more birds had been left
by the scourge on the lower beats of Strathmore than
on Dalnawillan. Those beats are the best ground
in Caithness, and if there are any birds there they
naturally will be. Dunbar looked the matter well in
the face, told the tale, the whole tale, and let it on a
seven years' lease, commencing, if I remember right,
with a rent of £300, increasing up to £575, or thereabouts.</p>

<p>The gentleman who took it knew exactly what he
was about. The good years that would accrue after
disease were before him.</p>

<p>The year after the expiration of the seven-year
lease and cycle, disease was again ravaging, and
there was little or no shooting for two or three years
after that.</p>

<p>The new tenant nursed the birds the first season,
killing only a few cocks or so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>In September, with one of the boys, I went over to
Orkney, to try the fishing of the Loch of Stennes.
We landed from the tub of a steamer that plied
between Scrabster and Stromness, after a terribly bad
passage across the Pentland Firth. The tide ran very
strong, the wind met it, and the steamer, built on the
lines of a walnut shell, rolled about in the trough of
the sea.</p>

<p>We landed, and hiring a cart to carry our traps,
tramped away to the top of the loch in Harray parish,
and lodged with Peter Flett, farmer and miller.</p>

<p>The trout were most beautiful, equal to any sea trout,
but not plentiful, anyhow very stiff to rise; they ran
all sizes. Our best day to two rods was 17-1/2lb., the
largest scaling 2lb. 6oz.</p>

<p>On one other day we had fish of 1lb. 4oz. and 1lb.,
and amongst our take were some half-pound sea trout.</p>

<p>The loch was terribly ottered by the small farmers
and crofters, but with very coarse horse-hair tackle.
Certainly they did not get many; but, no doubt, that
put them down from rising to the fly.</p>

<p>The ottering was not poaching, because every freeholder
had the right, and nearly all were freeholders.</p>

<p>I asked Flett where he got his land from. "My
father," said he; "and he had it from his father, and
his father before him." I dare say if Peter and I
could have traced it we should have found that the
title commenced with his Scandinavian ancestors, who
stole the land from the Pict, who lived in an underground
house designed after the pattern of an
improved fox-earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is done with the younger sons, Flett?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they go to the fishing, or into the Hudson Bay
Co.'s employment." That was primogeniture with a
vengeance. I wonder what the land reformers would
have to say to that.</p>

<p>"Flett, what deeds have you to show?"&mdash;"Deeds!
what do we want with deeds?"&mdash;"Well, suppose you
want to mortgage."&mdash;"Orkney people don't mortgage,"
says Flett, with his nose in the air.</p>

<p>In a few days we had enough.</p>

<p>We loaded our traps on Peter's cart, and returned
to Stromness, looking at an underground Pict's house
on the way, where perhaps Flett's ancestor had
disposed of the aborigines, by smoking them, and
stopping up the outlets, as you would stifle rats.</p>

<p>Also we saw the Stones of Stennis, which, as
Druidical remains, rank with Stonehenge.</p>

<p>We stopped on our way at the bridge that crosses
the outlet of the loch to the sea, to try for sea trout.
The tide water comes up to the bridge, and a little
beyond, and from the bridge to the sea was about a
mile.</p>

<p>On the rise and fall of the tide we landed six sea
trout weighing 6-1/2lb., the largest 2-3/4lb.</p>

<p>On the fall of the tide the sea trout stopped taking,
and then the sillocks came as fast as possible. We
had seventy-nine of them in little over an hour.</p>

<p>I was very much pleased with Orkney. The land
was good, and the climate was better than that of the
mainland.</p>

<p>There were some grouse, and, as far as I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
learn, the best moor was in Harray parish, where we
had been fishing.</p>

<p>The moor was a common, and the whole of the
commoners joined in granting a lease to the tenant
of the shooting. I think the rent was £35 a-year,
and he took off about 200 brace of grouse, and a
really considerable number of snipe and plover, and
I believe it was true that there was no disease. The
game sold for more than paid the rent.</p>

<p>Pretty much a repetition of the previous season;
grouse were increasing fast, but none to spare for the
gun.</p>

<p>I worked away at the cock birds, and let the boys
get their hands in on the outside beats, where the
birds would not be missed, breaking them in work as
well as the dogs.</p>

<p>In the spring of this year, carrying out the idea
propounded by Dunbar, utilising my experience of
American house building in wood, of which I had
taken careful particulars when in that country a year
or two previously, I built a small lodge near to
Altnabreac station, containing kitchen, parlour, and
five bedrooms, and let it, with 12,000 acres of moorland,
for three years&mdash;first year £200, second and
third year at £300 a year, including keeper, with a
proviso that if my keeper was of opinion that the
birds could not be spared the bag should be limited
to 100 brace in the first year, and in that event I
was to return £100 of the rent.</p>

<p>I did limit them, and sent them a check for £100.</p>

<p>The railway was open and a station stuck down in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the middle of the moorland four miles from Dalnawillan
Lodge and seven from Glutt, no road, or footpath
even, in any direction from the station.</p>

<p>It was stuck down in the centre of the moorland to
take its chance.</p>

<p>For the use of Dalnawillan and Glutt Dunbar and I
did our best to induce the proprietor to make the four
miles of road that was needed.</p>

<p>We offered during the tenancy of our leases to pay
the proprietor six per cent. on the £600, which was
the estimated cost of the road, and do the repairs
ourselves, but of no avail. At last it was settled that
I should make the road and find the money, the cost,
with interest at five per cent., to be repaid to me by
twelve equal yearly instalments, of which the proprietor
contributed half, Dunbar a quarter, and myself
a quarter. The road was made and open ready for
use for the shooting season of 1876.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>After about a fortnight at Dalnawillan I took a trip
into Shetland with my boy Charlie, to verify the
wondrous tales of sea trout that were to be had in
every tidal stream and loch.</p>

<p>It was a miserable disappointment, every fish that
could be had was poached on the spawning beds and
by any other means at any other time; but on some of
the outer islands, I believe, matters were better.</p>

<p>What there were were very fine fish; we had nine
in all, four of which weighed 6-1/2lb.</p>

<p>What a small world it is! Charley was fishing
away in Brouster Loch in waders up to his middle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
when someone calls out: "Holloa, Charley, what are
you doing here?" And there was his class master at
Clifton College also up to his middle.</p>

<p>On our return to Caithness we had a horribly stormy
passage from Lerwick to Wick, putting in for the night
at Kirkwall in Orkney, to shelter from stress of weather.</p>

<p>Lerwick is a very pretty little town, the most
northerly in Great Britain, doing a good and lively trade
in fishing matters, and having a great many visitors in
the season. For those cockneys who have the blessed
faculty of defying <i>mal de mer</i>, and enjoying bottled
porter and a pipe with the ocean in commotion&mdash;and
my experience, so far as it goes, is that in those
northern latitudes it always is in commotion&mdash;what
can be a pleasanter or a cheaper sea trip than to
go by the Aberdeen boat from London Bridge to
Aberdeen, and thence to Lerwick <i>viâ</i> Wick, and
round the islands in the trading steamer, and home
by the West Coast.</p>

<p>Shetland from the outside looks very nice. It is
indented in every direction with fiords, or voes they
call them there, with very fine cliff scenery.</p>

<p>But the inside is dismal, the crofters and fishermen
pare the turf and heather for winter bedding for their
cattle, and, what with that and peat cutting for fuel,
they leave the surface of the hills very black looking
and hideous.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>There is some good heather, perhaps about seven
thousand acres, in the main island, and it would, no
doubt, carry some grouse, if any means could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
devised for destroying the swarms of greyback gulls,
hoodie crows, and hawks.</p>

<p>Not a living thing can show, without being pounced
upon and devoured. The only game of any description
that I saw was two snipe; not even a rabbit.</p>

<p>Before I went it had struck me as an anomaly that
there should not be grouse, and I looked well into the
question of whether grouse could be profitably introduced,
but, looking at the small amount of moorland,
and the large cost, if not impossibility of destroying
the vermin, I gave up the notion. I notice from
letters in the <i>Field</i> and elsewhere that others are
agitating the question, and they will do well to
thoroughly bottom the question before incurring
heavy responsibilities.</p>

<p>One thing that strikes a visitor is the incessant
knitting on the part of every woman and girl; no
matter when or where, the knitting needles incessantly
ply. Carrying baskets of peats from the hills in creels
on their backs, still the needles ply in front.</p>

<p>Some of their knitting is very beautiful. The
common goods are knitted from imported yarn, but
the beautiful shawls are knitted from yarn spun
from the fully-grown wool of the indigenous native
sheep.</p>

<p>The wool is not clipped, but pulled when fully ripe.</p>

<p>The native sheep are of all colours, white, brown,
yellow, &amp;c., and many piebald.</p>

<p>With these colours the varied colours of the best
quality Shetland shawls are derived from the natural
colour of the wool, without dyeing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the shawls are exquisitely fine, and fetch
large prices. For one, many yards square, I gave £5.
Of course it was a unique specimen, and afterwards, in
England, I was assured that it was a cheap purchase.
It could be doubled up not much larger than a pocket
handkerchief.</p>

<p>At last a gleam of sunshine. Seasons 1873, '74,
'75, and '76, four long years practically blank, and
heavy expenses running the while; it was a heartbreaking
business, worse than my experience in
Banffshire. But at last I was to expect some
moderate shooting for two guns, and my expectations

<h2><a name="Season_1879" id="Season_1879"><span class="smcap">Season 1879.</span></a></h2>


<p>This was the eighth year that I had paid rental for
this moor, and this was the second year out of the
eight that it would afford shooting for more than two
guns.</p>

<p>I had a very fine stock of birds upon the ground.
I had nursed the stock judiciously. I had not shot it
down when recovering from disease, and at last the
moor was full of birds, and for the next two or three
years, until the scourge paid its next visit, we might
shoot and hammer away at the birds, without detriment.
Nothing that we could do in the way of shooting
could possibly reduce the breeding stock below
what it should be, until disease again reduced it.</p>

<p>I had relet the Rumsdale side, with 10,500 acres,
for three years, at £300 per annum, leaving, say
13,500 acres to Dalnawillan shooting.</p>

<p>We laid ourselves out for a fine bag, and we had it.</p>

<p>I said to David, "Last season, shooting with
Mr. Oliver, we made together over six hundred brace.
Now, we have treble the birds we had to begin that
season. If I go to work shooting steadily by myself,
say seven hours a day for four days a week, can I take
off 600 brace to my own gun and for once make a
swagger bag?"&mdash;"Yes, you can," says David.&mdash;"Then
I will do it," responded I; so it was arranged to shoot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the moor in two parties, myself one party, and two
guns in the other party; each party taking the beats
fairly in turn.</p>

<p>The second party of two guns was made up of the
three elder boys and a friend, shooting five days a
week, weather permitting, taking their turns alternately,
the men out, going after snipe and ducks and
fishing.</p>

<p>I started with 42 brace on the 12th, and on the 14th
52&frac12; brace, and continued to make good bags. On
August 26, my fifty-eighth birthday, I came in with 50&frac12;
brace; it was the second time over the beat, and on
September 15, in twenty-one days shooting, I
numbered 617 brace, close upon an average of 30
brace a day besides sundries.</p>

<p>Generally through Scotland moors had not fairly
recovered their full complement of birds, and I believe
it was acknowledged that 617 brace was the best bag
in Scotland made that season to one gun in the first
five weeks shooting over dogs.</p>

<p>We had a fine time and a very enjoyable time, and
up to the 16th of September, when we went south, we
had taken off 1138 brace.</p>

<p>In October I returned with two other men to shoot
under the kite, and we took off just 200 brace. When
at Glenmarkie, I could do nothing with the kite, the
birds rolled up before it and away for a couple of
miles.</p>

<p>October shooting in Caithness and Sutherland over
dogs under the kite when birds are plentiful, is very
grand sport. It is the acme of point shooting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>In October the air is crisp and bracing, there is
plenty of walking, and you are in the best condition,
or you ought to be.</p>

<p>The kite is a large kite, much larger than the
partridge kite used in England, and is flown very
high, and so covers a large extent of ground. It is
worked down wind in front of the gun, so the dog
has to work down wind and on ticklish birds; therefore
I need not say that it requires clever old experienced
dogs. Many good August dogs cannot get
into it.</p>

<p>Packs of six to twelve birds rarely sit well; they
rise at sixty to one hundred yards, but the small lots
and single birds sit fairly well, rising at twenty to
thirty yards.</p>

<p>They rise in front like a wisp of lightning, hardly
well up before they turn to the right or left and away
behind you. They should be taken just on the turn.
It is very difficult to get in a second barrel unless, as
they turn and go past they are near enough for a
skimming side shot.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Good driving shots have said to me that the man
who can walk and kill October grouse under the kite,
and kill them well, can kill anything.</p>

<p>October sport with the kite is very uncertain.
There may be too much wind or too little, and in that
month you sometimes get very bad weather and
more snow than is pleasant, and then of course birds
are very wild and unsettled.</p>

<p>Big bags cannot be made under the kite; an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
average of 15 brace per day to a gun is very good.
I never managed to make 20 brace; twice I have
made 19&frac12;, and could generally average 15.</p>

<p>There is an impression that the kite puts birds off
the ground, and generally makes them wild; but I
don't think so. Of course the beats are changed, and
my impression is that it has no more effect than an
eagle hovering and then going on.</p>

<p>Those who have kited and driven, tell me that
driving disturbs and unsettles the birds far more than
the kite.</p>

taking off fifty-four and forty-four and a half brace
respectively. I was in very good form, and began by
getting sixteen brace without slipping a cartridge.</p>

<p>After the first two days we shot in two parties of
two guns each. Up to September 16, when we went
south, we had 1284&frac12; brace.</p>

<p>In October I returned, with another man, to shoot
under the kite, and we made 188&frac12; brace.</p>

<p>Grouse had culminated to their highest level, the
highest ever known in the record of the Dalnawillan
moors, and were now to recede, and again undergo
the scourge.</p>

<p>In the spring, birds were looking well, and in great
plenty.</p>

<p>We could not say that there was disease amongst
them, in fact, we could have conscientiously said that
we had not seen a diseased bird. But, later on, we
saw barren birds, nests not so well filled as they
should be; and in August, many birds shabbily
feathered on the legs, and thin breasted.</p>

<p>There was nothing like the quantity of birds as in
the previous August, bad nesting would account for
that. Some broods would, perhaps, jump up, with one
or two miserable chirpers in addition to one old bird,
and barren birds also were plentiful.</p>

<p>The moor was shot in two parties of two guns each,
and afforded fair sport.</p>

<p>I was anxious about the birds, in fact, in my own
mind it was a foregone conclusion. But Black wrote
in the spring to say that there was a fair stock upon
the ground, and looking pretty well, though now and
again seeing a bad bird, and he was inclined to think
that disease was to pass over with the brush of the
previous year; but disease was due, and I had my
misgivings that history would repeat itself.</p>

<p>Nothing very particular occurred during the nesting
season, and in August we went down, expecting
some fair shooting, but it was not so; it was a
great disappointment. With all our experience and
careful watching of the state of the birds, they
had died off&mdash;imperceptibly dwindled away since the
spring.</p>

<p>Disease in this attack was very different in its aspect
from former attacks. They come on very suddenly,
sharp and decisive; but on this occasion I have no
doubt but that it had been hanging about all through
1881, and also in the spring and summer of 1882,
steadily wearing away the birds bit by bit.</p>

<p>There was little to shoot, and I agreed with my
neighbours that we should all spare our birds, and
nurse what were left. My tenant at Rumsdale would
not hold his hand, and shot away, to my serious detriment,
as it was the last year of his lease.</p>

<p>Disease had worn itself through in the season of
1882, and birds were clean, but very scarce, in the
spring of 1883, and needed careful nursing, so I went
down for a few days, hunting the ground, and found a
sprinkling of birds on Dalnawillan, and next to none
on Rumsdale.</p>

<p>Dalnawillan, carefully considering the matter, could
spare a few birds; what breeding stock there was
has done well, but there were not enough birds
to make it worth while to take down a party, so I let
the place for the season to two gentlemen, with a
limit of 300 brace, of course, at a small rent.</p>

<p>The attraction was the fishing and a pleasant lodge
and surroundings for their holiday.</p>

<p>By myself I went down for a fortnight to shoot on
the Rumsdale ground, to take off just what I thought
could be spared.</p>

<p>I found pretty well of birds on the beats adjoining
Dalnawillan, and took off 170&frac12; brace.</p>

<p>A fair, but moderate, breeding stock was left on
both moors.</p>

<p>This season was to me a red letter year in Scotch
sport; very considerable success rewarded my
personal endeavours in every way.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>During the month of April I fished on the Thurso
and on Loch More, as one of the party of eight rods,
all fishing from Strathmore Lodge, and I killed fifty-three
salmon.</p>

<p>Sixteen of them, weighing 164-1/2lb., I made in the
one day, the 15th, to my own rod on No. 8 beat of
the river. On that day good fortune seemed to
attend me at all points; they were taking surely in
heavy dead water pools, and I bagged every fish into
which I bent the rod&mdash;a most unusual circumstance.
Many never showed a rise, they sucked the fly under
water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>The first fish damaged the fly, the next fourteen
were taken with one fly, a small silver-grey, no change
of fly, but retied several times to the single gut cast.</p>

<p>The last fish, a fifteen-pounder, I had moved in the
morning, in fact the first rise, and the last thing before
leaving off I crossed the river and changed for a
larger size silver-grey as the light was failing, and at
that he came like a lion.</p>

<p>Not a single hitch or contretemps occurred during
the day. Certainly both myself and my gillie, Johnny
Sinclair, were desperately careful, examining and
proving knots of the gut casting line after every fish.
We were in for a good thing, and nothing that care
and attention would do was neglected.</p>

<p>That was the best day ever made on a Thurso river
beat and still holds the record, and in all probability
will continue to do so.</p>

<p>It was a very hard day's work; as the fish meant it,
I meant it, and I kept the fly going without intermission,
with an interval of ten minutes for lunch,
from 9.30 a.m. to 7 p.m.</p>

<p>The next day, a Saturday, and also the Sunday, I
laid up in the lodge with lumbago.</p>

<p>My good fortune still pursued me. My last fish at
the end of the month was upon Loch More, and was
the heaviest fish of the season, viz., 29lb., a magnificent
clean run fish, and he was taken on the same
silver grey that had killed fourteen fish on the great
day. That fly killed twenty-three fish in the month,
and is new assigned an honorary post in the fly box.</p>

<p>At the end of June, having obtained the necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
permission from the higher powers, I fished the Baden
lochs in Sutherlandshire for trout with the fly.</p>

<p>The lochs are three in number, and communicate,
all on one level, by two short water ways, and,
collectively, they cover some miles of ground.</p>

<p>Except to one shooting lodge they are nearly inaccessible,
and the boats upon the lochs, belonging
to the lodges, even if they had been available to me,
were too large, needing two gillies to row them, and
for trout fishing a large boat is a great drawback;
you can't go to work too quietly, or too gently either,
in boats or tackle. The shepherds' boat was light
enough, but unsafe.</p>

<p>It is a notion that Sutherlandshire lochs need a
large gaudy fly, but year by year I have been reducing
the size of flies, and fining down the gut.</p>

<p>Again, what is called a fishing breeze is a mistake:
if it comes, of course you must make the best of it;
but to kill trout cleverly and quickly let me have fine
tackle, a light 10ft. rod, and just a ruffle on the water,
and if rain is falling and dimpling the water, the less
wind the better; of course, if you fish big gaudy flies
and double handed rods, you get little without a
breeze.</p>

<p>To solve matters, I arranged to lodge with a
shepherd not far from the side of the top loch; he
gave me a room, and made me pretty comfortable,
and with tea and whisky, good red fleshed trout, eggs,
and a ham to cut at, I got along pretty well. Anyhow,
I was on the ground, and close to my work,
which was the main thing if I meant business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>I sent my own boat and gillie by rail, and then
carted it over, so I had the right boat for the work,
and a safe boat too, which is a point I always look to,
as the squalls of wind get up very suddenly on those
large lochs amongst the mountains.</p>

<p>I fished with great success, commencing June 30,
and fished for seven consecutive days, Sunday, of
course, excepted.</p>

<p>My total bag was 534 trout, weighing 198-1/2lb.,
which is an average of over 28lb. per day; my best
day was 113 fish, weighing 42-1/2lb.</p>

<p>I have not come across any trout fishing scores that
will beat this record of seven days fishing.</p>

<p>Fortune had again favoured me, excepting one day,
when it was a blazing sun; they were all good fishing
weather.</p>

<p>When August came, to my own gun my bag of
grouse was five hundred and a half brace.</p>

<p>Of all sport I know nothing so deeply exciting as
the steady head and tail rise of a heavy salmon, say
a 20lb. fish, and the firm tug that you feel as he goes
down.</p>

<p>Remember what Major Treherne says, "Don't
strike, that tug has fastened the hook if it is to
fasten;" but there is nothing so quietly satisfying
as the feel on your hip of a heavy pannier of brown
trout.</p>

<p>About the salmon you do as your gillie tells you,
plant your foot on that rock, or on that sod, and cast
there, and the fish comes (when he does come), as the
fly swings round two yards below, or rather comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
when he does come, the coming being a long way the
exception; but the basket of brown trout has been
your own doing&mdash;you have cast your little flies yard
by yard where your own experience tells you the
brown trout will come, and the gay little chap does
come.</p>

<p>It is all your own act and deed: the gillie has had
no hand in it, except bewailing the loss of time after
those messing trout, when elsewhere there might be
"just a chance" of the salmon that don't come.</p>

<p>I take it that it is every bit as sportsmanslike in its
way to kill the little brown snipe, or the little brown
trout, as to stalk the monarch of the glen, or rise the
monarch of the stream. As regards the snipe, he is
good to eat, and the monarch of the glen certainly
not. I suppose for punishment of my sins, I once
had to live for a week on the latter.</p>

<p>In passing, I may remark as to size of Scotch trout
taken with the fly.</p>

<p>In my twenty-six years experience of Scotch fly
fishing I have been accessory to the taking of only
four fish exceeding 2lb. each in weight.</p>

<p>It is my experience that, excepting two or three
lochs in Caithness and Sutherland, that the few fish
that exceed 1lb., so soon as they attain that weight
become predatory, feeding on their own species, that
flies and insects will not maintain fish of that size
in condition.</p>

<p>Circumstances prevented my family going down
(my boys were scattered in professional pursuits), so
I determined to let Dalnawillan for August and September,
and shoot at Rumsdale as a bachelor, and
with two other men.</p>

<p>The weather turned out very disappointing and
unsettled&mdash;daily storm showers; so consequently the
results on both moors did not come up to my
expectations.</p>

<p>In Rumsdale (why, I don't know) the weather was
worse than in any other part of Caithness.</p>

<p>Only one day was I out without being interfered
with by rainstorms.</p>

<p>In Dalnawillan the weather was rather better, and
in Strathmore heavy and dull, but not much amiss.</p>

<p>In October, I went down to Dalnawillan with two
other guns. There bad weather again followed us,
but we managed to make 177 brace.</p>

<p>This season was the culminating season of that
cycle, and we ought to have had better bags, but wet
weather makes the birds wild and skittish. I had
expected 1200 brace on Dalnawillan, and 800 on
Rumsdale, as a minimum; the birds were there to
do it.</p>

<p>This would be my last season, and I shot at Dalnawillan
with two of my sons and a friend.</p>

<p>My family did not go down.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I was very lame with rheumatism in
one leg, and could only get about a few hours every
other day, puddling over the near beats and working
the dogs myself, with a boy to lead a spare dog, and
a gillie to carry the birds.</p>

<p>The other party were out every day, weather permitting,
two guns to the party, and taking turn and
turn about.</p>

<p>Disease was now again getting due. We had some
indication the previous season, and this season we
had them all over the moor&mdash;barren birds, small broods,
a bad bird now and again; in fact, a repetition
identical with the commencement of the attack of
1881, and about the same result as to bag, which,
however, gave a fair amount of shooting.</p>

<p>On moors south and east there was little or no
shooting; but Strathmore on the north was much
better.</p>

<p>On the 13th I went over to Thurso to say good bye
to old friends, and the next morning I was away south,
thus terminating my grouse shooting days and my

     <a href="#anchor-hare_day" style="text-decoration: none;">
    <span class="smcap">A Hare Day.</span></a></h2>


<p>The blue, or alpine hare, is, as all Scotch sportsmen
know, a great nuisance in grouse shooting over dogs.</p>

<p>Do what you will there is in every dog an innate
longing to chase or point ground game in preference
to birds, and if blue hares are shot upon the grouse
moor in the sight of the dogs, nothing that you can do
will prevent the dog from pointing or drawing on the
track of other hares.</p>

<p>On well regulated moors blue hares are looked upon
as vermin, and all possible are killed in the late winter
months, when they are white, by the keeper, and sent
to market; but they make very small prices, not more
than 9<i>d.</i> to a 1<i>s.</i> after paying carriage.</p>

<p>When at Dalnawillan in October, before leaving it
was the rule to have a hare driving day on Ben Alasky
with two or three guns, the result being generally
about ninety hares and a few brace of grouse, and the
number killed have been included in the record of
sundries.</p>

<p>All the gillies, boys, shepherds, &amp;c., were on that
occasion pressed into the service.</p>

<p>There were two hills adjoining one to the other,
Ben Alasky and Glass Kerry, both about 1100ft. high,
and both were driven.</p>

<p>The party started about 11 a.m. from the lodge,
beaters and guns forming a line, taking the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
before them to about half way up Glass Kerry, getting
on the way two or three hares and a brace or two of
grouse.</p>

<p>Then the guns were sent forward to their posts.</p>

<p>The line of beaters sweep round the hill.</p>

<p>Perhaps fifteen to twenty hares may be had.
Luncheon is then taken on the ridge connecting the
two hills.</p>

<p>After luncheon the beaters in line start well at the
bottom of Ben Alasky, gradually beating round and
round in a spiral until they reach the summit.</p>

<p>It may take two hours.</p>

<p>It is the habit of the blue hare to mount the hill, but
some few break back.</p>

<p>The guns are in three butts, the first butt on the
summit of the hill, and the other two on the slope
below.</p>

<p>Odd grouse skim over the butts and fall to a clever
shot.</p>

<p>At times the hares come up in considerable numbers,
and the single gun (no loader) gets hot; but if a hare
escapes the one butt it gets across the fire of another
butt, and so very little escapes.</p>

<p>Then comes the collection of the slain and crippled,
and loading men and gillies with the slain.</p>

<p>The reader may say, Why not send a cart or pannier
pony? simply because the peat moss of Caithness is
too soft to carry a pony.</p>

<p>It was a pleasing little shoot, and the weather at
that time of year being generally stormy, the outlook
from the hill was very grand.</p>

<h2><a name="REMARKS_ON_THE_OUTCOME" id="REMARKS_ON_THE_OUTCOME"></a>
     <a href="#anchor-outcome" style="text-decoration: none;">
    <span class="smcap">Remarks on the Outcome of Disease.</span></a></h2>


<p>A perusal of the foregoing reminiscences will show
that grouse shooting, like other sports, is very
uncertain, and that really good shooting cannot
apparently be looked for in more than four seasons
out of seven, consequent on the ravages of disease.</p>

<p>With the exception of portions of Southern Perthshire
say the district west of Dunkeld, embracing the
Breadalbane Moors, which for many years have had
comparative immunity from disease, but will have it
sooner or later, the moors of Aberdeen, Banff,
Inverness, Ross, Sutherland, and Caithness are
attacked at pretty regular intervals, and an old and
experienced hand may spot the years of disease pretty
well in advance.</p>

<p>In Sutherlandshire the recovery is rather slower
than in Caithness, and the period of good shooting
rather less.</p>

<p>On the smaller moors on the north-east of Caithness
mixed up with the arable land there is certainly very
much less disease, and when the birds get a touch, it
is called a bad breeding season; as the tenant of a
very fair moor in that district put it, "We never have
disease, but we had a season of poor shooting as the
birds did not breed that year." Of course, that meant
disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>I take it that in that district, the climate being
better, the ground carrying few birds and being
sprinkled in patches mixed with arable, that the risk
of contagion is less, besides which, from the tendency
of birds to draw down from the higher to the lower
grounds in the storms of winter, the gaps caused by
disease get filled up.</p>

<p>The same remarks will apply to Orkney, and, more
favourably still, excepting that they do not fill up from
the higher ground; but in Orkney the moors are very
small, and no great quantity of grouse.</p>

<p>Are we to draw our conclusion from the experience
of previous years, not of one cycle, but of several.</p>

<p>If we are to avail ourselves of past experience, the
inference derived is that disease does run in cycles,
and that it is a provision of Providence to ensure the
survival of the fittest, and thus prevent the gradual
decadence of the grouse.</p>

<p>It would appear that grouse shooting runs in years
pretty much thus:</p>

<p>1st year.&mdash;Say disease; shoot down and stamp out
as far as possible.</p>

<p>2nd year.&mdash;A jubilee; but shoot old cocks.</p>

<p>3rd year.&mdash;A jubilee; but shoot old cocks.</p>

<p>4th year.&mdash;Moderate shooting; be careful not to
overdo it to the serious detriment of the good years
before you.</p>

<p>
5th year.&mdash;} Grand shooting. Shoot down all<br />
6th year.&mdash;} you can, and so get off all you can<br />
7th year.&mdash;} before disease does it for you.<br />
</p>

<p>But if the moor be shot ever so lightly in the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
and third years it is simply killing the goose for the
golden egg, your moor will not recover its stock and
give good shooting until the seventh year or the eve
of the next cycle.</p>

<p>The laird will say, "Eh! I shall get breeding stock
from my neighbours;" but what if his neighbours are
at the same foolish game.</p>

<p>My own experience has been not to let a moor,
excepting on lease, until I am quite certain that it can
properly afford the number of birds to which I may
limit it, and I think that I have pretty clearly shown
that it will not afford birds at all in the first and
second years, perhaps a few in the third, the killing
of old cocks excepted, which should be done by the
keeper.</p>

<p>The present modern practice of letting moors from
year to year, quite irrespective of whether from the
ravages of disease there are grouse to afford shooting,
and so leading to the destruction of the little breeding
stock that may exist, has ruined and destroyed the
reputation of many fine moors that will carry heavy
stocks of birds if properly treated.</p>

<p>They year after year yield little or no sport, and
naturally get a bad repute until they are again caught
by disease and shelved for further years.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>The laird has to make up his mind to one of two
options:</p>

<p>1. To let his moor on lease at a low reasonable rent;
or</p>

<p>2. To retain his moorland, and nurse the birds until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the moor is full, and then let at a higher rent either
for one year or more.</p>

<p>Any other course is suicidal to him in the long
run; he may deceive his client, and perhaps himself,
and get a heavy rent for one year and then he
is done.</p>

<p>In the season of 1883, with a full knowledge that
the moor has been cleaned out with disease and over
shooting in 1882, I was asked, will you let me Rumsdale
with a limit of 150 brace for £100.</p>

<p>My reply was, that firstly there was not 150 brace
upon the moor, and that if I let it I should be cheating
him, and that if I did, shooting the little there was
would do me far more damage by the loss of the
breeding stock than the value of the £100, or three or
four times the £100.</p>

<p>It is difficult to educate people to the knowledge of
the fact that the breeding of grouse is like the breeding
of other animals or birds, and that grouse are not
in some mysterious way showered down by Providence
like manna in the desert.</p>

<p>It is appreciated as regards pheasants, but appears
that it has yet to be learned as regard grouse.</p>

<p>I have remarked that as a rule moors are more
readily let, and higher rents are obtained in the disease
year, the year following the cycle of three or four big
years, than at any other period.</p>

<p>Men are jubilant and excited over the successes of
the three or four previous years, the prestige and the
glamour are fostered by those in the interest of
letting, and folks are unwilling to believe, as I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
in the season of 1866, that such magnificent sport
can collapse almost at once to nothing.</p>

<p>Disappointments result for a couple of years or
more, and then moors become very unsavoury, and
really good places are on hand, and at moderate rents
for the ensuing three or four years.</p>

<p>It is evident that if history is to repeat itself, that,
looking at the cost of keeper and other expenses,
it is cheaper to rent for three or four years at a high
rent than to take for seven years at a low rent, taking
your chance, or, more properly speaking, the certainty,
of the fat and the lean.</p>

<p>Anyone about to take a moor of fair repute may, by
taking the necessary trouble before he signs the
agent's agreement to pay £500 or £1000 for what
Providence may send him, ensure himself the sport
represented by the high rent.</p>

<p>According to the amenities of the place&mdash;for the
number of brace to be killed is not the only factor in
fixing the price&mdash;the rent will vary from 10<i>s.</i> to 20<i>s.</i> a
brace, and an intending tenant should not grudge it if
he gets the sport.</p>

<p>Let the moor be run with dogs by a competent
keeper, and he will tell you if there is sufficient
breeding stock to breed the promised 1000 brace.</p>

<p>Then ascertain, <i>positively and absolutely</i>, when the
last attack of disease occurred; it will be the year
after the last successful season.</p>

<p>Then take the moor for a term of years, ending in
the seventh year from the date of the disease year.</p>

<p>Those moors that suffer the most in their disease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
year, like the moor in Strathspey, referred to in
Season 1871, will probably afford the heaviest shooting
in their good years.</p>

<p>Grouse, of course, have other drawbacks besides
disease.</p>

<p>If the moors are on high ground, they are liable to
have eggs frosted in late frosts, or young grouse
killed by late snowstorms, as occurred in Season 1864
on Glenshee. Again, you may have a lazy, whiskey
drinking keeper, who neglects vermin-killing; but,
as a rule, once out of the egg, the young bird
is safe.</p>

<h2><a name="HEATHER_BURNING_AND_DRAINING" id="HEATHER_BURNING_AND_DRAINING"></a>
     <a href="#anchor-burning" style="text-decoration: none;">
    <span class="smcap">Heather Burning and Draining.</span></a></h2>


<p>Indiscriminate burning of heather is another great
drawback on Sutherland and Caithness moors.</p>

<p>In Caithness, it will take fourteen or more years to
grow deep, good heather on the hill moors, and in
Sutherland eight or ten.</p>

<p>The upper moors of Caithness, and also of parts of
Sutherland, carry very little really good heather; in fact,
only on the burn banks or dry knolls does it grow.</p>

<p>The remainder of the ground is broken, knotty peat
bog, with short stunty heather, and stretches of deer
grass, with wet flows on the upper flats. All good
shooting ground in fine weather, and birds like it then.</p>

<p>Birds rely on the deep heather for shelter and food
in the winter. Burn that out, and they go where they
can find it, and don't return. It is just the same as if
you burn down a crofter's house and his crops, he
must move on to somewhere else.</p>

<p>Some of the best moors in Caithness have been
ruined, and cannot be recovered for very many years,
to the very serious loss of the proprietors, from incessant
burning and shooting down breeding stock after
disease, both attributable to the almost culpable
negligence, certainly ignorance, of those in charge of
the regulation of the burning and the letting of the
moors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>The burning is a far more serious business than the
shooting down of stock.</p>

<p>One fool of a factor did say to me (he is dead
and gone, or I would not name it), "Perish every
grouse, before a blade of grass shall suffer."</p>

<p>The sheep rent on the moor to which the above
referred is gone because sheep do not now pay on that
ground, and the grouse rent&mdash;the best rent of the two&mdash;is
also gone, because the heather is burned off clean
as the back of your hand.</p>

<p>In Dalnawillan, heather burning has been with me a
constant wrangle with the proprietor or his representatives,
or the sheep farmers, no matter the clear
agreements to the contrary, protecting the heather.
If I was fighting anybody's battle, it was in the interest
of the proprietor; the question was one far more
important to him than to me.</p>

<p>Burning, to do it properly, is a very expensive
process on such extensive ranges as the Caithness
moors.</p>

<p>In Dalnawillan and Rumsdale, it needed four parties
during the early part of April, to do it properly, four
men in each party. One man to kindle, and keep on
kindling; the other three men armed with birch
brooms, watching and regulating the course of the fire,
beating it out where it unduly spreads, or beating it
out altogether to rekindle in case of a change of wind
in a wrong direction.</p>

<p>Unless the weather is quite dry for a week or more,
the rough ground and deer grass, both of which it is
most desirable to burn in the interest of grouse and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
sheep, will not burn, and when your staff of men are
collected and got together, a sudden storm of rain or
snow comes on, and you are delayed for a week, and
perhaps put off altogether for that season.</p>

<p>Naturally, if you are prevented by weather from
burning, the sheep farmer is annoyed, because he
does not get his burning done. He argues, "Let me
burn; I will burn as much in a day as you will in a
week." And so he would, but it would be the fine
old heather that will burn, and the shooting value of
the moor destroyed for many long years.</p>

<p>I do not say that sheep farmers or their shepherds
desire to burn, and damage the shooting tenant, and
also the proprietor (not that the latter or his factor
understand the question or appreciate the damage)
by burning out patches of good heather, the burning
of which destroys the cover appertaining to hundreds
of acres, and so destroys the shooting.</p>

<p>One shepherd certainly, said he liked the ground
burned, because it was easier walking.</p>

<p>But if the shepherd is to burn, what can he do by
himself.</p>

<p>He can do no more than kindle a fire, and let the
winds of heaven take it how and where it likes.</p>

<p>To get a good fire, he will get his back to the wind,
and kindle a well-heathered burn, and make a good
clear sweep for half-a-mile, and so destroy the shelter
of five or six hundred or more acres for a dozen years
or more.</p>

<p>I have seen two miles in a blaze at one time, but
not on my ground; it was too well looked after.</p>

<h2><a name="SURFACE_DRAINING" id="SURFACE_DRAINING"></a>
     <a href="#anchor-draining" style="text-decoration: none;">
    <span class="smcap">Surface Draining.</span></a></h2>


<p>I am convinced that much may be done in improving
grouse ground in the north of Scotland.
Make ground habitable and suitable for grouse, and
they will come without any further trouble.</p>

<p>Grouse like wettish ground, especially in hot
weather, presuming that there is dry ground available
for them to nest upon, and feed and sit upon in wet
weather.</p>

<p>Now, by judicious surface draining, much may be
done.</p>

<p>When the ground slopes from the low hills, the
surface water works over the face of the ground,
thoroughly soddening it, and rotting the heather that
would otherwise grow.</p>

<p>The drains are simply small sheep drains cut on
the surface, slantingly across the slope, wherever there
is fall enough just to run the water.</p>

<p>The drain intercepts the water, runs it off, preventing
it from running over the ground below the
drain, and immediately dries the ground immediately
<i>below the drain</i>. Heather grows some yards wide,
and there the birds will sit and nest, and you have
created increased grouse ground.</p>

<p>The expense, in view of the benefit is very trifling.
A pair of drainers during the summer months, say a
cost of £50, will get over a very large extent of ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>The proprietor was constantly endeavouring to sell
the property, in which event my lease would drop
through, and he was impervious to any arrangements
as to draining, otherwise I should have done the whole
of the Dalnawillan ground. As it was, I did do
some odd bits, at my own cost. One beat, near the
lodge, I scored over with a few hundred yards of
draining, and converted it from a bad to a good beat.</p>

<p>Such draining, of course, improves the ground for
sheep as well as grouse.</p>

<p>I presume the time will come when proprietors will
see that profit will accrue from cultivating their moors
for the purpose of carrying grouse, by endeavouring
in all ways to improve the heather by judicious
burning and draining, in sufficient amounts to carry as
large a stock as is reasonable for the extent of ground.
I see no reason whatever, if you offer as favourable
conditions to the birds, why they should not be as
plentiful on ground A as on ground B; as a matter of
fact they will be.</p>

<h2><a name="DOGS" id="DOGS"></a>
     <a href="#anchor-dogs" style="text-decoration: none;">
    <span class="smcap">Dogs.</span></a></h2>


<p>To some men (certainly it is so to me) one great
element of the pleasure of walking shooting <i>versus</i>
standing shooting, viz., the driving of grouse, partridge,
and pheasant, is the working and use of dogs where
they are useful and essential to success, in the particular
sport for which they are used.</p>

<p>Do not let it be inferred that I am detracting from
driving, or the skill and experience that is necessary
to do it well, both in beaters and guns.</p>

<p>Each sport is delightful in its way and in its season.</p>

<p>The Yorkshire grouse cannot be brought to bag
without driving, and so with partridges and pheasants
in certain counties.</p>

<p>But I do feel more delight in hunting the game than
in having the game hunted towards me.</p>

<p>I have always worked a perfect retriever broken by
myself and kept to myself, a dog keen to his work,
and who keeps by your side, not at heel, as he needs
to see what is doing, if he is to help you to his uttermost,
who keeps his nose on the alert, and tells you
by a look when you are passing a close sitting partridge
or rabbit or hare in its form, and who tells you if
the partridge covey is still in front or run up the right
or left furrows of the swedes, who stops with you until
told to go, and then goes quietly back to where he
saw the bird drop, and takes up the scent of the dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
or running bird; not a dog who, when told to go
rushes and tears about hoping to flush the winged bird
into sight, or put up and chase some wretched rabbit,
which is far more to his taste.</p>

<p>I have never done any good with pedigree dog-blood
as shown on the show bench. Of course, on
the show bench it is not pretended for one moment
that any good is to accrue in a sporting sense; all is
sacrificed to shape, size, and coat, which in a sporting
dog get it if you can, but probably you have to do
without some points if you get brains and keenness.</p>

<p>Napoleon, Wellington, and Gen. Sheridan were all
small men, and their physique would not have commanded
prizes on the show bench.</p>

<p>Again, for field trials dogs are bred up for that
business only, and are rarely used for sporting.</p>

<p>At a field trial you want a bold pretentious dog
that will go in and do just one or two things in a
certain form, stand hares and rabbits, if he does it in
proper form, and as to whether he is an industrious
good worker, that is a matter of indifference. A really
good dog, if a little shied by the crowd round him, will
be quite out of the running in a field trial. I don't
say but that some field trial dogs may possess high
qualities that are useful as a cross in breeding.</p>

<p>I raise no objection to dog shows, they afford
pleasure to numbers of people. What I desire is that
the inexperienced sportsman shall not look in that
direction for his sporting dogs.</p>

<p>Caithness birds, especially in catchy weather, run very
much when pointed and drawn upon. Clearly, like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
red-leg partridge, he tries his legs well before he will
take to wing. Sometimes they will road over 100 yards
or more, and it is an unexplained mystery to me how
a brood will cross a burnt and bare patch in front of
you as fast as you can comfortably walk, without showing
themselves.</p>

<p>Old solitary cocks are terrible fellows for this, and
if your dog does not foot them fast they will outwalk
you, and ultimately rise wild.</p>

<p>One old brute pointed well fifty yards within the
march, took me such a distance across the Dunbeath
march that I began to be so thoroughly ashamed of
my trespass, that when he did rise and drop to the
shot, I felt half inclined to let him lie and come away.</p>

<p>To my mind working a brace of dogs is a mistake.</p>

<p>Rap, we will say, gets birds and Ben backs him;
certainly a very pretty picture, if the dogs do it well.</p>

<p>The birds draw on, and Rap draws on, Ben remains
behind, stands like a fool&mdash;the poetry of the picture is
gone, perhaps he draws on in Rap's footsteps.</p>

<p>Besides if you want to work your dogs in pairs you
will need double the number in the kennel, ay, and
an extra dog breaker as well.</p>

<p>In the course of a six or seven hour day, to work a
party, you will need, if you work them singly, three
experienced dogs and two younger ones coming on
to work.</p>

<p>In Caithness and Sutherland necessarily wide
ranging a little over two hours early in the season, is
enough for an old dog, and less for a young one
coming on, and four days a week is about as much as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
they will do, and if the gun shoots four days a week,
it is as much as he can do to shoot properly. A man
who is careful of himself will get more birds in four
easy days, than the enthusiast who works long hours
and six days.</p>

<p>If you want to get birds, keep yourself and dogs and
gillies fresh and in good form, and so that when birds
rise they shall also fall.</p>

<p>I have heard of dogs that will work all day long and
every day as well, but I have never yet been fortunate
enough to come across that very remarkable and
desirable strain.</p>

<p>Here let me give a sketch that is no mere flight of
fancy.</p>

<p>The 26th of August, my birthday.</p>

<p>It is a sunny day with a gentle balmy wind, and the
heather, which is full in bloom, is dusting your boots
white with its pollen.</p>

<p>It is a lazy day for birds, and they will not much
care to run.</p>

<p>Daisy is ranging pretty wide, and, getting an indication
of birds, pulls up and looks over her shoulder
towards her master.</p>

<p>"Has she birds, David?" "She is no sure." You
walk slowly up to Daisy, she draws on, and her point
gradually stiffens; another twenty yards and she stops
full point; you both walk on, the old cock bird rises
first at twenty-five yards, and he goes down, you load,
and the hen and three young birds rise within ten
yards.</p>

<p>Take it calmly, don't smash up the old hen by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
taking her too soon, and, after her, down with one of
the young birds; load quietly and quickly. Daisy
stops where she is; up gets another bird and that goes
down.</p>

<p>Smoker is sent forward, and he gathers and brings
in the old hen and two young birds from out of the
deep heather.</p>

<p>No doubt the old cock is a runner.</p>

<p>David and Daisy sit down whilst I go forward and
put Smoker on to where the old bird dropped.</p>

<p>We sit and watch him; see the old dog threading
the scent at a quick pace in and out amongst the peat
hags.</p>

<p>Oh dear, the bird has taken down the burn and we
may lose him.</p>

<p>But no; an hundred yards below out comes Smoker
from the burn triumphant, with the old cock, which
he delivers up without a scratch save the broken
pinion.</p>

<p>Daisy is now away to find a fresh point. What has
Smoker pointing there, with a look that says as plain
as dogs can speak, that fool, Daisy, who thinks so
much of herself in her hurry to get fresh points, has
left a close sitting bird in that tuft of good heather.</p>

<p>Yes, Smoker is right, as he always is in all he does,
and another bird is flushed and bagged.</p>

<p>The brood was seven, and now but two away, thanks
to the studious care and intelligence of my two four-footed
friends.</p>

<p>And what fine birds, with their white speckled
breasts! the young ones as large as the old ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>We pile them in a heap for the gillie to collect as
he comes along.</p>

<p>Dear old Daisy, there were better dogs with better
noses and grander action, but the loving creature did
her very best to bring birds to bag by care and gentleness,
and she did it too.</p>

<p>That retriever, Smoker, the second of his name,
has now passed away, and his place taken by a worthy
third, was a character.</p>

<p>Amongst other things he was born defective in
the power of propagation.</p>

<p>I bred him from a bitch that I bought in Norfolk
solely to breed him from; the father was a dog
belonging to a keeper of Col. Kenyon Slaney.</p>

<p>There were only two dogs in the litter, all the
others being bitches.</p>

<p>He was a poor puny thing, and would have been
consigned to the bucket with sundry of his sisters, had
there been other dogs in the litter.</p>

<p>But as he grew, and he grew fast, he showed signs
of great intelligence.</p>

<p>When old enough, he was sent down to Dalnawillan,
to David's care, and there again I saw him when nearly
full grown, when there fishing in June.</p>

<p>He knew me again. "Is he steady and quiet,
David?"&mdash;"Oh, yes." So we took a walk.</p>

<p>He looked at me out of the corner of his eye, as
much as to say, "I wonder if he means to be my
master: I will have a try;" so he chases a lamb. I
came up with him; he drops the lamb, and away again
after the same lamb; aye, and once again after that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
The lamb takes to the river, and I after him. I get
hold of the lamb and take it ashore, and put it by my
side. It was not really hurt, but in a sad state of mind.</p>

<p>At last, up comes Smoker, and receives a real
roasting, that satisfies him as to who is to be master,
and I trust that retributive justice also satisfied the
injured feelings of the lamb.</p>

<p>He was, without exception, the rankest and most
determined puppy I ever handled. At times I thought
I must give him up; but he repaid my trouble.</p>

<p>At home in the autumn, a pair of partridges were
down in some deep feg he was put upon. Up jumped
a hare, far more interesting to Smoker, and he away
after. Whistle, whistle, yes until you be hoarse; he
would not come.</p>

<p>Again the question had arisen as to who was to be
master, so I sat myself down a good half-hour before
the guilty rascal came to heel; but when he did, and
he knew perfectly well what was coming, a hazel
stick, cut specially for his education, effectually
reminded him.</p>

<p>He lay on the ground, and howled and moaned.
Whips were of no effect, he laughed to scorn such
mild trifles.</p>

<p>Dogs never mind being thrashed, if they deserve it.
Don't do it oftener than you can help, and then do it
effectually.</p>

<p>Smoker gets up, wags his tail, has a bit of biscuit to
cement renewed friendship, limps a good deal, and
goes to work, and cleverly gathers first one and then
the other bird.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>Only for me would he work. Not a dump did he care
for keeper or any other body, but just went his own
wilful way.</p>

<p>He was gentle as a lamb. Little children and small
dogs might do as they liked with him. My daughter's
pug regarded him with a mixture of intense jealousy
and reverence, but that did not prevent Toby from
occasionally attacking him tooth and nail, much to the
amusement of Smoker.</p>

<p>He was free of the library, and a constant partaker
of five o'clock tea when not out at work.</p>

<p>For many years Smoker, in the season, worked on
grouse, with Daisy, a setter bitch, and with other
dogs.</p>

<p>There was great jealousy between him and Daisy,
but both good natured over it.</p>

<p>Daisy was very fond, if she could manage to elude
attention, of quietly retrieving a bird, and it was as
good as a play to observe her delight and his indignation
at her encroachment upon his part of the work.</p>

<p>I could tell endless tales of his ability and intelligence.</p>

<p>When not at work, he was the laziest of dogs, but
any symptoms of shooting about he was all life. His
great object was, then, to get hold of my shooting
cape. He had some idiotic notion that he had a lien
upon me by so doing, and that I was bound to go out
to shoot.</p>

<p>On one occasion I was away from home, and a lady
in the house induced him to walk with her in the
garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>As she went through the porch, she took my walking
stick.</p>

<p>Smoker, presently, in his quiet, gentlemanly way,
took hold of the stick, as the lady thought, to carry it.
But no, Smoker walks back and deposits it in the
porch, as much as to say, "None of that, when my
master is away."</p>

<p>In my time, I have had many good pointers and
setters.</p>

<p>I have no prejudice as to which, but pointers are
more easy to break; but, then, in those northern
latitudes they do not stand the cold so well as setters
do.</p>

<p>In breeding, you may reckon that out of four
puppies, you will not get more than two out of the four
that turn out fairly well, and for dogs of exceptional
intelligence not one in twenty; ay, in fifty.</p>

<p>Rap, who pointed my first Scotch grouse was, take
him all in all, as good a pointer as I ever had.</p>

<p>Grace, a setter bitch that I worked at the same time
as Rap, was charming in every way.</p>

<p>She was a puppy of the Rûg breed from North
Wales. How I came by her I forget, and from her I
bred many good dogs, but never anything of exceptional
excellence.</p>

<p>The best setter I ever handled was Ben, an ivory
coloured setter, a first cross between a Gordon and a
Laverack.</p>

<p>He was perfect in his work, but a bit rank if the
whip was spared.</p>

<p>He would go to the dead birds after they were down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
if he possibly could, that is, if he had the least licence
granted to him.</p>

<p>Pointing and retrieving were all one to him.</p>

<p>He would watch a towered or a stung bird, and let
him go and he would go straight, judging distance
well, a thing very few retrievers can do; and if the
bird did not rise again, he would to a certainty bring
him.</p>

<p>The only retriever that I have seen judge distance
with a towered bird was a large black dog belonging
to the late Sir Stephen Glyn. He marked the bird;
the ground being difficult he went, not straight, but
across other fields to the right of his bird.</p>

<p>I never did any good with red Irish setters, but it
does not follow that, others may not have done so,
but I very much doubt it.</p>

<p>I was persuaded to buy a beautiful young pedigree
bitch puppy, warranted from dogs that on both sides
were worked on grouse. She was perfect in shape
and colour, but the veriest fool that ever ranged a
moor.</p>

<p>After a season's experience not work, for she never
did any work except range beautifully, David said that
I had better shoot her.</p>

<p>No, I said; I will advertise her in <i>The Field</i>, and I
did as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A very handsome &mdash;&mdash; pedigree red Irish setter
bitch, useless on the field, no nose; probably make a
winner on the show bench."</p>

<p>I had several applications, and got a few pounds
for her, which I handed to David.</p>

<h2><a name="DISEASE" id="DISEASE"></a>
     <a href="#anchor-disease" style="text-decoration: none;">
    <span class="smcap">Disease.</span></a></h2>


<p>Touching on the very vexed question of the cause
of disease, I will say very little; as to its effects I
have said a great deal.</p>

<p>If the poultry fancier keeps a lot of old birds about
him, or too thick upon the ground, disease breaks out
amongst them.</p>

<p>I take it that on all moors at the end of six and
seven years after the last attack, there will be a lot of
old birds, and, as with the poultry, disease breaks out
and is contagious, and Nature asserts her rights for
the survival of the fittest.</p>

<p>The districts west of Dunkeld are probably the
healthiest in all Scotland, and so there birds resist
disease, but disease has even there made a clearance,
and will again.</p>

<p>Yorkshire grouse are now all driven; the old birds
come first and are killed off, and we all know that
since driving came into vogue, Yorkshire birds are far
more healthy.</p>

<p>Were it permissible to hunt the ground in the
northern Scotch counties at end of July, and kill off
the old birds of the brood, which could be readily
done, it would probably stamp out, or at any rate,
postpone, the attacks of disease.</p>

     <a href="#anchor-wildfowl" style="text-decoration: none;">
    <span class="smcap">Wildfowl.</span></a></h2>


<p>One other matter is worthy of note in Caithness,
and that is the steady yearly decrease of wildfowl.</p>

<p>The upper Caithness moors are breeding ground for
wildfowl, geese, ducks, widgeon, teal, plover, and
snipe, all, or nearly all, make their way down to the
lower ground, so soon as they can flap or fly.</p>

<p>They are not killed in the country to any extent,
and if reduced by shooting, it must be by the punt
guns in the south, wielded by Sir Ralph Payne
Galwey and his colleagues.</p>

<p>As to golden plover, where seventeen years back
there were a dozen pairs in the spring time, there will
not be more than one or two.</p>

<p>A number of arctic birds nest on the flows, gulls of
various kinds&mdash;the skua gull, redshanks, and greenshanks
(a rare bird), black ducks, divers, and many
others.</p>

<p>In the late October, there are considerable flocks of
snow buntings.</p>

    <span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span></a></h2>


<p>My tale is now told. Despite the many bad seasons,
the many disappointments, the rod and the gun have
kept me going, more or less, year by year, and will, I
trust, again, upon the home manor, the trout loch, and
the salmon pool, and I have nothing to regret in my
Glenmarkie and Dalnawillan leases.</p>

<p>They have afforded me, occasionally, splendid sport,
and endless pleasure to my family and to myself.</p>

<p>The fine air of Caithness, direct from the Arctic
Pole, the good water, and the healthy exercise, have
contributed to their good health and mine, and to
their well being, far more than trips to the English
coast, or the Continent, whilst the lads have been
made good sportsmen with rod and gun, and their
holiday pursuits have given them genuine, honest
tastes, as well as healthy recreation.</p>

<p>Twenty-four years of Glenmarkie and Dalnawillan
leases have resulted in nine splendid seasons; five
middling ditto; one very middling; and nine with
practically no shooting.</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

<p>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

<p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
